title: The Great Awakening
---

I find it strange, as someone who works in the technology field, to have such a contrarian view of technology. Someone who's very job it is to connect things together has been burdened and yearns to disconnect.  
  
Lately I've spent a great deal of time reflecting on how technology is so inter-woven into the fabric of our lives. When you look at the past the rise of technology is nothing new. As humans we've continued to create and innovate since the beginning of time. I feel however that it has only recently been with the rise of mobile devices and social media that this technology, this direction we are headed in, is of negative consequence.  
  
I don't believe it was until I had my first child that I started to realize the impact of what mobile devices were doing to the family and thus society. I noticed my son tugging at my arm while I was checking email. I noticed my son jumping in my lap while I was updating Facebook. I noticed my son FIGHTING for my attention. What I've now come to realize is that others have given up the fight, they've felt left out and joined the conversation online. Enough of us have called friends and family to connect through our preferred online network that we are slowly forgetting how to interact face to face.  
  
I see people waking up and slowly realizing the impact of their connectivity. I see people slowly putting down their phones and interacting face to face. I feel that we are facing a Great Awakening.
