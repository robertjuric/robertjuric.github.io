I'm studying for my ICND2 exam regarding static and connected routes, these notes are for my own understanding.

Secondary IP addresses can be assigned to an interface to allow forwarding to multiple subnets on the same LAN.

Sub-Interfaces are logical subdivisions of a physical interface, allowing each sub-interface to be attached to different subnets/VLANs.
