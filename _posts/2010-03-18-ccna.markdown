![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4443221390_cffd097418_o.jpg)I have to apologize for not taking some time off, however I have had my nose in a book for the past month studying for my ICND2 exam. I've been preparing mostly by reading, practicing subnetting, and practicing on the exam simulator. I went yesterday morning to take my exam... and passed!! I'm now a full CCNA! I am still excited and I feel like I have had a large burden taken off my shoulders.

I thought I would share a few quick tips, or at least things that helped me study:



	
  * Subnetting - Practice, Practice, Practice
I study subnetting in two ways: memorizing my chart and then practicing to find the subnet address. For the ICND2 or CCNA exam, I would recommend adding the wildcard masks as a column to remember, it might come in handy. I practiced writing my chart top to bottom, left to right, and then backwards just to make sure I knew it. I timed myself a few days before the exam to see how long it took me to copy the entire chart /20 - /30, it only took me about 2 minutes. That makes it well worth it to write down the chart once the exam begins to have as a reference later.
I also practiced subnetting by practicing finding the subnet address and the range for that subnet. I found a great site online that provides random practice problems [here](http://faculty.valleycollege.net/rpowell/jscript/subnet2.htm).

	
  * Exam Simulator
I also spent a good bit of time on the exam simulator trying to answer the study questions. Honestly as I was using the exam simulator I didn't do as well as I had hoped and was nervous about taking my real exam. However, the questions on the actual exam seemed to be a little easier, so after taking the exam I felt exam simulator did a great job of helping me to prepare.

	
  * Real-World Experience
I have to say real-world experience is invaluable on the exam. I had already configured VLANs and ACLs and spent some time with STP so I felt comfortable with those questions. The company I work for utilizes a MPLS network and we only have a few legacy frame relay circuits still alive, so those questions seemed to prove the most difficult for me.


I would like to encourage anyone else wanting to take CCNA exam to go ahead and schedule the exam, study hard, and just do it.
