I wanted to give a quick update on my current job situation. Since it is what I do all day, it produces most of the ideas and content that I fill my blog with. My current position has me wearing multiple hats. While my title is Network Engineer, I'm also standing up a VMware environment, administering a few NetApp SANs, and ensuring the infrastructure servers (DCs, AV, etc.) are in place. With these additional responsibilities I've started to have more ideas for blog topics related to virtualization. 

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up so you weren't left wondering when virtualization posts start appearing on what had been a solely network-related blog. I might also start writing about general office life in the IT career field as well, depends on how the stats react.  I will keep networking my primary focus, as it is my primary interest, but we'll have to see where this converged position takes me (and this blog).
