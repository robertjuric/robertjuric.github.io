I pulled the trigger. I did some research and found a solid way to import my wordpress posts into a text/markdown format. I've put all my previous posts into my `_drafts` folder while I work on cleaning up the markdown, correcting photos, and removing stale content. I've also redirected my domain to my GitHub pages URL while I figure out what to do with the domain.  

In the mean time, I'm back on Twitter [@robertj180](http://twitter.com/robertj180) if you want to chat.
