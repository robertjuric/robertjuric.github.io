I recently found an opportunity to teach a networking class at a local ITT Tech campus. Before I got the job I had to give a short "practice teach" on a topic of my choice. I picked network cabling since it would be fast and easy for me to cover. I thought I'd share my slide presentation from the quick class. There isn't much 'meat' to the slides because I was trying not to lean on the slides and instead do more speaking. The practice teach went well so I thought I'd share the slides, this is also my first attempt at using [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) so it's a good experiment for me.
