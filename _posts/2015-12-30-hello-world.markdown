Hello from Jekyll/GitHub Pages. In an effort to clean up my online writing I plan on migrating my domain and blog to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages. 

For me this means a few changes:  

* Renewing my GitHub skills  
* Learning to write in MarkDown (KramDown to be exact)  
* An effort to publish more consistently  
* More focused content

I'm still debating what content I want to move over, so that may change. I'll keep you posted with updates and an overview of how I've managed the migration.
