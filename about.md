My name is Robert Juric. I live a pretty busy life. First and foremost, I am a Christian and a happily married father. I stand in awe of God’s creation. I’m a problem solver, and I enjoy the challenge of building things.

Professionally I am a network engineer. At work I am interested in service provider networks, enterprise data centers, and the new technologies emerging for them. I am certified and able to work with multiple network vendors; I am also proficient with other data center technologies including virtualization and storage.

At home I enjoy spending time with my family and doing things outside. and coffee.
