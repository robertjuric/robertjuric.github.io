I've always been fascinated with infrastructure systems, the power grid, the interstate system, the global internet. Something about breaking down a large complex system I find mind blowing. Throughout my career I've been able to grow my experience from a medium sized business IT department, to Department of Defense Networks, to a global internet service provider. Just like an interstate highway or power distribution grid, I strive to ensure the networks I manage are open and available, meet the demand needed, and perform optimally. 

My most recent position has provided me with an opportunity to lead a team of engineers. This has opened a new level of fulfillment in my career. I went from being concerned with bits and bytes to being concerned about the welfare and productivity of my team. Now I focus on removing roadblocks and providing a productive environment for the team.

Outside of work I believe a sound body is essential to a sound mind. I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, camping, and hunting. I like to stay active in the gym, mountain biking, and most recently playing hockey. Learning to play hockey later in life has been a very eye opening experience. Admitting that I'm not good at something, but committing to improve myself through dedication and practice has been life changing. It's been a lot of fun to challenge myself with a sport that is hard and difficult.
