3/30/2015 13:51,Gaggia New Baby Steam Wand,"We recently purchased a refurbished Gaggia New Baby espresso machine and grinder. We've been very pleased with the results (and the cost). The one complaint (and the only one so far) was the stock steam wand. It did a great job at making foam, though more than we care for and it was a pain to keep clean. I saw online that it was possible to replace the steam wand on a Gaggia Classic with one from a Rancilio Silvia so I took the chance and purchased a Rancilio Sivlia steam wand for $15 from eBay. What follows are the general instructions necessary to make this swap work on a Gaggia New Baby.

First, remove the water tank and disconnect the power. Then remove the two screws from the back side. The are located underneath where the water tank was located on the black plastic. No need to remove the ones on the silver plastic.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1092"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2608"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next pull the steam control knob straight up to remove it and remove the screw at the top of the machine.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1093"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2609"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next lay the machine on its back with the bottom facing up. There are 2 screws underneath, next to the group head.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1091"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2607"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next stand the machine upright and slowly pull the black cover straight up to remove it from the rest of the machine. There is enough slack in the wiring harness which allowed me to keep everything connected, I just laid it aside. You'll see where the hose connecting to the steam wand is located and there is a small plate with 2 screws. Remove the screws and slide the plate up. The factory wand will pull up through the housing.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1087"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2598"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

The next part is probably the hardest step, but that isn't saying much. There is a plastic clip securing the wand to the round ball and the hose. I found the easiest way to do this was the secure the wand in my left and use my thumb and forefinger to put upward pressure on the ball. Then take a small flat head screwdriver and use it to push the 3 clips inside the ball toward the center. Keeping the upward pressure will hold them as work you way around to all 3 clips inside. I've tried to capture this as best as possible but it was hard to get a good shot.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1088"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2600"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

With the clip removed slide it down the factory wand and pull out the factory wand.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1089"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2602"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

I saw on some videos that the Rancilio Silivia wand had a flared end that sometimes had to be ""flattened"" in order to remove the large factory nut. Mine was not flared and the nut and washer easily slid off when I unscrewed the nozzle. I just put the plastic clip onto the Rancilio wand and pushed it back into the ball.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1090"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2603"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Re-assemble in opposite order. Secure the cover on the steam wand, put the case back on. 2 screws underneath next to the group head, one under the steam control knob, finally the last 2 screws on the black plastic underneath where the water tank sits. Then just screw the nozzle back onto the Rancilio wand, and give her a spin.

12/24/2010 21:03,Optimizing e-Books for Kindle,"<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-356"" title=""Before"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""491"" height=""277"" /></a>

I've recently started uploading more technical documents to my Kindle for ease of access. But to compete with paper documents, I have to be able to access the information quickly. This means I rely heavily on the navigation built into the Kindle. I like to be able to jump straight to the Table of Contents, click on the chapter I want, or be able to quickly skip chapters. So what's wrong with this picture? This comes from a PDF e-book I purchased from CiscoPress and copied to my Kindle. There are 3 major things I have a problem with in this PDF. 1. There are no click-able links in the Table of Contents. 2. The Go To menu is missing an entry for the Table of Contents. 3. There are no tick marks to use the five-way controller for navigation. These are pretty major problems for me because it only allows me to read the document straight through, however I'd much rather be able to skip around through the book. Let's see if there is a better way to do this...

What we're going to do is convert the PDF to a PRC file. This will allow us to create the navigation that we want, but it will take a little extra leg work in order to properly apply the finishing touches.

1. First, Download and Install <a href=""http://www.mobipocket.com/en/DownloadSoft/ProductDetailsCreator.asp"" target=""_blank"">Mobipocket eBook Creator</a>

2. Import Your PDF for Conversion
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-360 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot006"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""472"" /></a></p>
<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot007.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-361 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot007"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot007.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""469"" /></a>Take note of the publication folder, our next step involves browsing the publication folder to find an image to use as the Cover image.

3. Locate and Set the Cover Image
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-369 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot008"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""461"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-370 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot009"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""471"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">4. Next we have to edit the .HTML file so that we can find the HTML Anchor names to create our TOC item on the Go To menu.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-373"" title=""ScreenShot010"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""434"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here we can see that there is an anchor named ""link1"" designating the Contents page in the book. We'll now add this reference as a TOC Guide Item.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-374"" title=""ScreenShot011"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""470"" /></a>To create the link, we select the .HTML file by browsing for it, and then appending the HTML anchor of the Contents page. Next we need to save the project to create the .OPF Mobipocket project file.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">6. At this point we can either call it quits and build the .PRC file, or we can push forward and create a .NCX file so that we can use the five-way controller for navigation. I agree, let's move on and do this right.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Araby Greene wrote a great guest article <a href=""http://www.cjs-easy-as-pie.com/p/create-ncx-file-by-araby-greene.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> discussing the NCX file and it's use in-depth. I suggest you read the article and then come back for a high-level of what you need to add a NCX file to your project. Alright, now that you're back let's build our NCX file. You will have to go back to the original .HTML file we edited and search for more anchor names for each of the chapters, and also any other items such as preface, index, appendix, etc. that you may want to add. For my test example I used the Contents page, and Chapter 1 and 2:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-376"" title=""ScreenShot012"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""432"" /></a>The key items needed to create the navPoints are an id, the sequential playOrder (the order for the ticks), the text for the label, and the HTML link and anchor.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here is a building block example:</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE ncx PUBLIC ""-//NISO//DTD ncx 2005-1//EN"" 
  ""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx-2005-1.dtd""&gt;
&lt;ncx xmlns=""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/""  
  version=""2005-1"" xml:lang=""en-US""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:uid"" content=""uid""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:depth"" content=""1""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:totalPageCount"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:maxPageNumber"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;docTitle&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Title&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docTitle&gt;
&lt;docAuthor&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Author&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docAuthor&gt;
&lt;navMap&gt;
&lt;navPoint id=""uniqueID"" playOrder=""1""&gt;
&lt;navLabel&gt;&lt;text&gt;TextLabel&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/navLabel&gt;
&lt;content src=""link.html#anchor""/&gt;
&lt;/navPoint&gt;
&lt;/navMap&gt;
&lt;/ncx&gt;
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">7. Next, save this file as TOC.ncx and place it in the Publication folder.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">8. Now we have to edit the .OPF project file to add insert a reference to the .NCX file:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The code to paste is:</p>

<pre>&lt;item id=""ncx"" media-type=""application/x-dtbncx+xml"" href=""toc.ncx""&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/manifest&gt;&lt;spine toc=""ncx""&gt;&lt;itemref idref=""item1""/&gt;&lt;/spine&gt;</pre>
You are essentially adding an item to the manifest and rewriting the spine.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-377"" title=""ScreenShot015"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""433"" /></a>9. Now we can save the .OPF and build the .PRC

10. We can download and install the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621"" target=""_blank"">Kindle Previewer</a> to open up the .PRC and verify the tick marks show up. Next we can copy the .PRC to the Kindle and enjoy an easily navigable reference document.

And voila...
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-378 aligncenter"" title=""After"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""478"" height=""270"" /></a>We now have click-able links in our Contents page, a shortcut to the Contents page in the Go To menu, and tick marks we can use to skip chapters using the five-way controller. A few caveats though: when importing the PDF into Mobipocket it might not create a link for every item in the table of contents. This could easily be fixed by modifying the .HTML file and adding anchors and links. I feel as long as I get the chapters linked I'm 80% happy. I also noticed that the 13.6mb PDF file I first started with turned into a 6.4mb PRC file.</p>
So if you are as detailed orientated as I am, you can now enjoy your tech docs in geeky bliss.

Merry Christmas!",,
9/20/2015 9:44,Displaying Code in Wordpress Posts,"<em>Last verified as of Wordpress 4.3.1.</em>

I'm going to show how I use different Wordpress formatting to relay segments of code or commands in my posts. I normally write my posts using the plain 'Text' edit mode because I enjoy the simplicity and control.

The first and least special way I like to relay code or command syntax information in my posts is to switch to the Visual edit mode and then use the 'Italic' and 'Increase indent' formats.
<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Toolbar.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1216 size-full"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Toolbar.jpg"" alt=""Toolbar"" width=""856"" height=""68"" /></a>

Which produces results like this:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>router# configure terminal
router(conf)# interface gi0/0
router(conf-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0</em></p>
The other format that I like to use when I want to highlight commands within a paragraph. I do this in 'Text' edit mode and specify the &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; tags around the text. Doing so lets me <code>highlight a section of code</code> within a sentence to signify that it is a commnd or piece of code.

If I want to set aside an entire block of code with multiple lines I like to use the &lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; tags in addition to the &lt;code&gt; tags.
<pre><code>This allows
me to use multiple
lines of code
grouped together</code></pre>
This is my favorite way of displaying blocks of information because it emphasizes its importance and keeps multiple lines together.

The last bit of advice I would offer is that sometimes when I display a command syntax there are ""variable"" components to the command such as an interface name or a description. When I display something as variable I like to surround it with the &lt; and &gt; symbols. However since Wordpress is HTML based it assumes that text is an HTML tag and won't display it correctly. To overcome this you have the replace the ""&lt;"" symbol with the text ""&amp;lt"" followed by a semicolon, without the space: &amp; l t ;. The same goes for the ""&gt;"" symbol but using gt instead of lt.
<pre><code>router(conf)# interface &lt;name&gt;
router(conf-if)# description &lt;your description&gt;
</code></pre>That's all I've got for now. Knowledge is power.",,
3/31/2015 15:37,Adding Support for Wordpress Post Formats,"I use the AlienWP Origin theme on this site, and I'm quite happy with it. I've recently changed the way I share things online (I cancelled my social media accounts), so I wanted a way to share other formats on my website, sort of like Tumblr format. I thought the built-in Wordpress Post Formats would be a great way to accomplish this. Until I realized my Origin theme doesn't support them. So what I did is extract the theme to create a child theme (something I should have done some time ago), finally after some searching and kludging I was able to find a working solution. The information is easily found online, in various formats, but for my lack of Wordpress experience it took a little trial and error to find the relatively simply solution.

<h3>Child Theme</h3>
The first thing I did was create a child theme from the Origin them. They offer this on their website but you have to pay for a support subscription. I'm sorry I'm not going to pay for a blank child version of a theme you offer for free under the GPL. I did leave all references to AlienWP and their Origin theme. To create the child theme I created a file <code>style.css</code>:
<pre>/**
* Theme Name: Origin Child
* Theme URI: http://alienwp.com/themes/origin/
* Description: Origin is a minimalistic theme with responsive layout. The theme supports custom header and background, plus a number of extra settings: link color picker, typography options, and a nice selection of Google fonts - built into the new WordPress theme customizer.
* Version: 0.5.6
* Author: AlienWP
* Author URI: http://alienwp.com
* Template: origin
* Tags: flexible-width, theme-options, threaded-comments, microformats, translation-ready, rtl-language-support, one-column, two-columns, right-sidebar, sticky-post, custom-background, featured-images
* License: GNU General Public License v2.0
* License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
*
*/</pre>

Next I created a <code>functions.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
function theme_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
	wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',
        array('parent-style')
    );
}
?&gt;</pre>

I also had to copy the <code>index.php</code> file to the child folder. Because I don't like constantly updating files, you can go ahead and create 2 empty files for now, <code>content.php</code> and also <code>content-quote.php</code>, or you can create these as you go and upload them individually to your theme folder.

The rest I'm going to generalize for the sake of simplicity, it easily applies to any theme.
<h3>Adding Post Format Support</h3>
The first step necessary is to add support for the post formats to your <code>functions.php</code> file:

<pre>add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'link', 'image', 'quote', 'video' ) );
	add_post_type_support( 'page', 'post-formats' );</pre>

Next go into your <code>index.php</code> file and <b>extract</b> the entire loop. Mine started with <code>&lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;</code> and ended with <code>&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;</code>. So cut out everything between those lines and paste it into your <code>content.php</code> file. This is used when a post has a non-standard post format specified.

Then go into your <code>index.php</code> file again and where that empty space is where you removed your original loop code, paste this new code:

<pre>&lt;?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?&gt;</pre>

This replaces your loop with a call to individual content-<i>whatever</i>.php formats, or calls the default content.php format depending if it's specified or not. Next for each format type you will need a content- file. For example we will use <code>content-quote.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
		/**
		* The template for displaying posts in the Quote post format
		*
		*/
		?&gt;        
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>

Believe it or not it really is that simple. At this point you should be able to go to Add New post and select the Quote format, when you publish it you should see it on your front page with the specialized styling. From here you create content files for each post format and style them as you wish. If you have any questions hit up the comments.

EDIT:
To get the next post to show up on my summary front page I had to make some changes to the <code>content-quote.php</code> file. I'm not sure if this is core, or just related to my origin theme, but I thought I would share:
<pre>&lt;?php
/**
 * The template for displaying posts in the Quote post format
 *
 */
?&gt;      
&lt;?php do_atomic( 'before_content' ); // origin_before_content ?&gt;  
&lt;div id=""post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;"" class=""&lt;?php hybrid_entry_class(); ?&gt;""&gt;
	&lt;?php do_atomic( 'open_entry' ); // origin_open_entry ?&gt;
        &lt;div class=""entry-summary""&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;
        	&lt;blockquote:before&gt;
		&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;
	        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-summary --&gt;
	&lt;?php do_atomic( 'close_entry' ); // origin_close_entry ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .hentry --&gt;
&lt;?php do_atomic( 'after_entry' ); // origin_after_entry ?&gt;</pre>",,
6/1/2015 10:07,Raspberry Pi Home Calendar,"I bought a Raspberry Pi a while back with grand delusions of a digital signage/home calendar display for our kitchen. After coming up short on solutions I eventually gave up and boxed it all back up. Well I stumbled across a solution the other day that gave me reason to dig the Pi back out and get that display working.
<h2>The Display Solution</h2>
The solution I finally found that warranted display in our kitchen was <a href=""http://designelemental.net/mpanel/"" target=""_blank"">mPanel</a>. mPanel allows integration with iCal links, Weather Underground API for custom weather, links to Flickr for beautiful background photos, and does all of this in a beautiful package. Setting up mPanel is fairly straightforward. You'll need to request a free API from Weather Underground for local weather, the display looks amazing and even has red alert boxes in case of storm warnings. I linked it to my Google iCal URL to get a feed of calendar events, however I noticed that if there is an alert configured it would hide the event name, this is probably something I'll circle back to later. I also created a Flickr album with photos around our backyard to cycle through as backgrounds.?ÿ Once I had mPanel all configured, it was a simple matter of making it display properly on the Pi.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/home-display.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1181"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/home-display-e1433174693577-300x186.jpg"" alt=""home display"" width=""300"" height=""186"" /></a>
<h2>Full Resolution Display</h2>
I already had my Pi running previously on a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/"" target=""_blank"">NOOBS/Raspbian</a> image. The first thing I had to fix was the HDMI output on my TV had black bars on the sides and wasn't utilizing true full screen. This was a simple fix by disabling overscan.

1. From CLI:
<code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code>
2. Remove top comment so that:
<code>disable_overscan=1</code>
3. Update NOOBS config at bottom so that:
<code>#overscan_left=24
#overscan_right=24
#overscan_top=16
#overscan_bottom=16
disable_overscan=1</code>
4. Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.
5. <code>sudo reboot</code>

I was then able to start the GUI full screen open Midori and view my mPanel page in all its glory. Except that it would occasionally hang and not refresh. I realized that the full GUI was pegging CPU utilization at 100%, so I thought it would be better if I could launch Midori directly from the CLI. After some research I finally found a solution that was lightweight enough.

The first thing I had to do was install the <a href=""https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/projects/matchbox"" target=""_blank"">Matchbox window manager,</a> x11-xserver utilities to keep the display on 24/7, and unclutter to hide the mouse:
<code>sudo apt-get install matchbox
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
sudo apt-get install unclutter</code>
Then I created a startup script
<code>sudo nano startMidori</code>
Which looked like:
<code>#!/bin/sh
xset -dpms?ÿ # disable DPMS (EnergyStar) features
xset s off?ÿ # disable screen saver
xset s noblank?ÿ # don't blank the video service
sudo unclutter &amp;
matchbox-window-manager &amp;
midori -e Fullscreen -a http://startupsite.com</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.
I was then able to run the script to open Midori full screen to my mPanel page:
<code>xinit ./startMidori</code>
<h2>Automate It</h2>
Now that I had a working script and a working display I just needed a way to automate the login process and auto-execute my script. The first thing we have to do is automate the login process. To do this we need to make some changes to the /etc/inittab file.

Open the file:
<code>sudo nano /etc/inittab</code>
Navigate in the file to the following line:
<code>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1</code>
Put a comment before that line to disable getty:
<code>#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1</code>
Right after that line add the following line to run the login program with Pi user:
<code>1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 &lt;/dev/tty1 &gt;/dev/tty1 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now to just run my Midori script after login we will edit the profile:
<code>sudo nano /etc/profile</code>
Add the following line to the end of the file:
<code>xinit ./startMidori</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now just reboot the Pi one more time (sudo reboot) and enjoy your automated calendar goodness.

Here is my Pi until I get around to purchasing a case and hiding it behind the TV:

Installation was fairly straightforward. I had broke the tabs off my switch console, but Joe was kind enough to include some ""L"" brackets which had been hammered to roughly 45 degrees which made for a great replacement. I also ordered the two boots to replace my dissolved leather ones. The console plate came with instructions but the boots were just there. I just folded them like the previous boots and super-glued them in place. I'm also debating leaving off my driver side cup holder, I am enjoying the extra knee room.

You can see from the first picture there is a bit of a gap at the top of the plate, I'm going to email Joe as I'm sure this is an installation error on my part. Overall I'm very excited about the new clean look. I would highly recommend this combo.",,
4/8/2015 21:01,Discovery 2 Rear Seat Belt,"When I purchased our Discovery 2 I noticed one of the seat belts had a cut in it that prevented the clip from sliding freely. Given that I have a small child I wanted this fixed asap. I was able to find a used seat belt and got to replacing my torn belt.

Tools required: <a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0014_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1165"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0014_2-300x225.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0014_2"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

That's a 17mm socket, phillips and flat head screw drivers, and a trim removal tool.

The first step was to remove the trip at the top edge of the rear cargo area, this piece just has clips on it so just use trim removal tool to pry it out.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0006_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1157"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0006_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0006_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

Once that piece is removed you can remove the top trim piece along the side. There are trim push pins that need to be removed with the trim removal tool.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0005_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1156"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0005_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0005_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>Also along the top there is a small bracket (already shown removed) that is used to mount the dog shield. You'll have to pop the screw cover out and then use a flat head to remove it.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0002_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1153"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0002_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0002_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>Finally there are 2 screws near the bottom of the side window which will have to be removed. You can see it pictured (it's the one with the small ring around it).

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0003_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1154"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0003_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0003_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

Then pull the plastic cover behind the top of the seat belt holder and pull out the top trim piece. Now you're free to remove the bottom trim piece. There is a grill piece next to the rear door that pops off, inside it there is a trim push pin(it's the black dot in the picture).

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0011_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1162"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0011_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0011_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>There are also 3 push pins inside the side storage if your Discovery is configured with them. Then there are 2 screws, one at the top near where the seat belt comes out, and another where the 12v connection is.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0013_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1164"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0013_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0013_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0012_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1163"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0012_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0012_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>There is a piece at the top around the seat belt exit that can be popped off. Then you can slide bottom trim piece out and away, though you don't need to move it too far, just far enough to reach the bottom of the seat belt.

Now to remove the seat belt itself there is the first bolt next to the rear seat.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0001_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1152"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0001_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0001_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>Then the top.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0007_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1158"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0007_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0007_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>And finally the bottom.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0009_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1160"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0009_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0009_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

And this is where things when bad for me. When I received the new/used seat belt I wondered why it was big knotted mess, so of course I undo the knot and let it roll up to keep things neat. Big mistake. Once the seat belt rolls up to far it is (as far as I can tell) impossible to slacken. I read online that it might be possible to open it up to free the paws and pull it slack.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0008_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1159 size-medium"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0008_2-e1428547813471-300x248.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0008_2"" width=""300"" height=""248"" /></a>

Well I got it open, but getting it back together was another story. At this point I had one bad belt on a working retractor, and one good belt on a broken retractor. I was about to give up and order a whole new belt when I became curious as to how the belt is secured to the retractor. Sure enough there is a loop on the end with a small stick securing it from pulling through.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0010_2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1161"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_0010_2-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0010_2"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

In what I consider a stroke of pure genius, I unravel the good retractor, and while holding it in place I removed the black pin, pulled out the torn belt, pulled in the new belt, re-inserted the pin, and let it spin back together (I tied a knot in it this time).

If you didn't have the problem I did with the belt it would have been much more simple to just swap out the entire thing. Re-assemble everything in reverse and now I've got a seat belt I don't mind putting my child behind!",,
3/25/2015 19:29,Pittsburgh Radiator Pressure Test Kit,"One of the first things suggested I do with my new Land Rover Discovery was to test the coolant system for any leaks.

I figured why not and swung by my local HF to pick one up.

When I was removing the test kit I noticed some coolant on the pump itself so I think the pump itself was actually what caused it to look from 16 back to 15psi. Overall I was happy with my purchase and would recommend this kit, I'm not sure how long it would hold up durability wise though being from Harbor Freight. I was even more excited that I believe my Discovery is not leaking coolant!",,

12/23/2015 10:53,Working Remote,"As 2015 comes to an end, it marks a year I've spent working remote. I work for a large service provider in managed enterprise services. While I work remote, the majority of my colleagues work in an office somewhere. I personally have really enjoyed being able to work from home. I thought I would share some of my experiences and insights from the past year.

One of the major reason I wanted to work from home was family time. With the nature of my work, it doesn't really provide me with a flexible schedule (not as much as I would like) however I don't have a commute and I'm able to see my family throughout the day. I enjoy grabbing some coffee or lunch at home and being able to see my wife or son. When I initially stopped to think about why I was working, and what I was really working toward from a whole life perspective it all came down to family. Working remote has definitely allowed me more time with my family.

One thing I have noticed, it was a fear of mine from the beginning and is still a nagging issue, is the fear or missing out. Since I am not in the office with most of my colleagues I miss out on the water cooler talk and the gossip. I don't hear news until it has been made official and I usually don't get the personal insight I would if I was having a chat with my boss in the office. I understand also that since I'm not in the office I don't get face time with the boss, which could possibly hurt my chances for promotion (out of site, out of mind). However I believe I work hard and do good work, I don't think that goes unnoticed but I've accepted a peer may be considered for promotion before I am. I have acknowledged this, and personally given the choice I would still rather work remote and see my family more often.

I get a lot of comments from friends and family how they could never work from home. They'd just stay in their pajamas all day and not get any work done. This hasn't been an issue for me. I've made it a point to stay disciplined in this area because I believe it is important to keep the family life separated from the work life, even though they share the same space now. I wake up every morning at 5am and have an espresso. I'll either workout or study before work. I always shower, shave, and put on a collared shirt (and pants) before signing into work. I believe if I don't have the mentality to take my work serious that it will show in my work performance. 

A few things I've noticed that I would like to work on during the next year are really intended to make working at home more enjoyable. One of the benefits from working from home is my own office (mine even has a window), something rarely seen in a cube farm office. This also allows me to have my own desk arrangements and I like using my custom standing desk. The lighting in my office could use a little update, usually I have enough natural light from the window that I don't even turn on a light, but on cloudy days or late nights the lights in my office are a little too yellow for me. I also plan to make some adjustments to sound absorption, while I haven't had an issue with this yet there is plenty of opportunity for isolating household noise from my office. I'll probably add some sound absorbing panels outside the office in the hall and a sound stop to the bottom of my office door. 

Overall I've been quite happy working from home, if you have the opportunity I would advise you to consider and weigh all the pros and cons to make sure that it is the right choice for you.",,
12/23/2015 9:35,RIP - Routing Information Protocol,"RFC 1058 - Routing Information Protocol
RFC 2453 - RIP Version 2
RFC 2080 - RIPng for IPv6
<h3>Metrics</h3>
As a distance-vector protocol RIP utilizes hop count as its metric. A directly connected network has a metric of 0. When a network is advertised, the receiving router will accept the route and increase the hop count by 1. Unreachable networks have a metric of 16. This allows for a maximum metric of 15 which can make the protocol unsuitable for larger topologies.
<h3>Communication and Updates</h3>
Both RIPv1 and RIPv2 utilize UDP port 520. RIPv1 communicates via the layer 2 broadcast address and RIPv2 utilizes IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.9. RIPng utilizes UDP port 521 and communicates via the IPv6 Multicast address FF02::9. RIP is able to send unicast updates by specifying the neighbor. RIP first requests an update at boot/start, and then sends updates at regular intervals and when a topology change occurs. The RIP network statement specifies which interfaces will participate in the RIP process. To suppress updates on interfaces you can use the <code>passive-interface</code> feature.
<h3>Timers</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The routing-update timer is the time between sending gratuitous routing updates, generally 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>The route-timeout timer is the time after not receiving an update from a router before marking the learned routes from that router as invalid.</li>
	<li>The route-holddown timer is the time a route with better metric is suppressed before replacing the lesser route in the routing table.</li>
	<li>The route-flush timer is the time after marking routes as invalid before they are removed from the routing table</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redistribution</h3>
A default route can be originated with RIP and other protocols can be redistributed into the RIP domain. When redistributing from other protocols into RIP you must specify a default-metric to be applied to the redistributed routes.
<h3>Summarization</h3>
RIPv1 and RIPv2 (by default) are classful routing protocols and will automatically summarize routes to the classful network. In RIPv2 you can disable this auto-summarization by specifying <code>no auto-summary</code>. In RIPv2 you can also summarize routes by specifying a RIP summary address under the interface configuration.
<h3>Authentication</h3>
RIPv1 does not support authentication. RIPv2 supports either plain-text or MD5 authentication, with plain-text being the default.
<h3>IPv6</h3>
IOS-XR does not support RIPng. In IOS you create the RIPng process with the <code>ipv6 router rip WORD</code> command and then under each interface you must specify the ipv6 rip process.
<h3>PE-CE Configuration</h3>
When utilizing VRFs in a provider environment the RIP configuration is applied to an address-family configuration for each VRF. The version 2, disabling auto-summary, and networks must be specified within the address-family configuration.",,

RFC 2080 - RIPng for IPv6
<h3>Metrics</h3>
As a distance-vector protocol RIP utilizes hop count as its metric. A directly connected network has a metric of 0. When a network is advertised, the receiving router will accept the route and increase the hop count by 1. Unreachable networks have a metric of 16. This allows for a maximum metric of 15 which can make the protocol unsuitable for larger topologies.
<h3>Communication and Updates</h3>
Both RIPv1 and RIPv2 utilize UDP port 520. RIPv1 communicates via the layer 2 broadcast address and RIPv2 utilizes IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.9. RIPng utilizes UDP port 521 and communicates via the IPv6 Multicast address FF02::9. RIP is able to send unicast updates by specifying the neighbor. RIP first requests an update at boot/start, and then sends updates at regular intervals and when a topology change occurs. The RIP network statement specifies which interfaces will participate in the RIP process. To suppress updates on interfaces you can use the <code>passive-interface</code> feature.
<h3>Timers</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The routing-update timer is the time between sending gratuitous routing updates, generally 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>The route-timeout timer is the time after not receiving an update from a router before marking the learned routes from that router as invalid.</li>
	<li>The route-holddown timer is the time a route with better metric is suppressed before replacing the lesser route in the routing table.</li>
	<li>The route-flush timer is the time after marking routes as invalid before they are removed from the routing table</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redistribution</h3>
A default route can be originated with RIP and other protocols can be redistributed into the RIP domain. When redistributing from other protocols into RIP you must specify a default-metric to be applied to the redistributed routes.
<h3>Summarization</h3>
RIPv1 and RIPv2 (by default) are classful routing protocols and will automatically summarize routes to the classful network. In RIPv2 you can disable this auto-summarization by specifying <code>no auto-summary</code>. In RIPv2 you can also summarize routes by specifying a RIP summary address under the interface configuration.
<h3>Authentication</h3>
RIPv1 does not support authentication. RIPv2 supports either plain-text or MD5 authentication, with plain-text being the default.
<h3>IPv6</h3>
IOS-XR does not support RIPng. In IOS you create the RIPng process with the <code>ipv6 router rip WORD</code> command and then under each interface you must specify the ipv6 rip process.
<h3>PE-CE Configuration</h3>

RFC 2080 - RIPng for IPv6

Overview
All versions of RIP are considered distance vector protocols. Being a distance vector routing protocol, RIP utilizes hop-count as a base metric for route selection. When a router receives a routing update that includes a change to an entry it will update its routing table by increasing the hop-count by 1 and including the sender of the route as the next-hop. After updating its routing table the router will immediately send a routing update to the other RIP routers.

Communication and Updates
Both RIPv1 and RIPv2 utilize UDP port 520. RIPv1 communicates via the layer 2 broadcast address and RIPv2 utilizes IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.9. RIPng utilizes UDP port 521 and communicates via the IPv6 Multicast address FF02::9. RIP sends updates at regular intervals and when a topology change occurs.

Metrics
As a distance-vector protocol RIP utilizes hop count as its metric. A directly connected network has a metric of 0. When a network is advertised, the receiving router will accept the route and increase the hop count by 1. Unreachable networks have a metric of 16.

Neither my MBA nor my physical host has an optical drive. I found the solution on the <a href=""http://blog.macrepairsouthlondon.com/hardware/networking/create-esxi-usb-installer-mac-os-x/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Repairs Lond blog</a> but I wanted to summarize for posterity:

Format the USB drive using DiskUtility with FAT and a MBR.
Open the terminal and find the mount point of the USB drive
<code>diskutil list</code>
Then unmount the disk and use fdisk to mark the partition as bootable
<code>diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk#</code>
<code>fdisk -e /dev/disk#</code>
This enters fdisk interactive mode so enter the following commands to mark the partition and write the changes.
<pre><code>f 1
write
quit</code></pre>
At this point I mounted the USB drive and copied all the contents from the .iso to the USB drive.
One last step, find the file <code>ISOLINUX.CFG</code> and rename it to <code>SYSLINUX.cfg</code>. Then edit the file and find the line that starts <code>APPEND -c boot.cfg</code> and append <code>-p 1</code> to the end. Save and Exit. You're ready to stick the USB drive in and boot the ESXi installer from USB.",,
12/18/2015 11:18,Installing Cisco VIRL using ESXi Host Client,"I recently gave away my last Windows PC and vowed never to return. As a result I'm left with a MacBook Air for our general home use. I've wanted to get a VIRL lab setup since I heard about it, I even purchased some modest hardware to use as a host. However I was hesitant to proceed with VIRL because I was concerned with being able to manage my lone ESXi host without a Windows PC to install the vSphere client. I recently learned about a great new tool to manage standalone ESXi servers, the <a href=""https://labs.vmware.com/flings/esxi-embedded-host-client"" target=""_blank"">ESXi Embedded Host Client</a>.

The host client is a VIB that you install directly on your ESXi host which offers a web interface to manage the host. You're able to configure most items on the host, access VM consoles, and some limited performance monitoring. It really is a great tool, however it doesn't have the full functionality that the vSphere client does. It is also only a Fling with VMware Labs, so its future is not certain. With this new tool I decided to plow along and get my VIRL lab up and running.

The first first issue I ran into was getting the ESXi .iso file onto a boot-able USB drive since my host hardware did not have an optical drive (neither does my MBA). The DiskUtility on OSX was recently changed with El Capitan so most of the how-to articles I found didn't apply or wouldn't fully function. I finally found a working solution from the <a href=""http://blog.macrepairsouthlondon.com/hardware/networking/create-esxi-usb-installer-mac-os-x/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Repairs London blog</a>. I <a href=""http://robertjuric.com/tech/esxi-bootable-usb-from-mac-osx/"" target=""_blank"">summarized it here</a> for posterity.

To get started I first installed ESXi (I used version 6 Update1). After the installation was completed I configured a static IP and enabled SSH. I then proceeded to install the ESXi Host Client VIB. The instructions are on the Host Client website. I used the SCP + SSH options to copy the file over and then execute the esxcli commands to install it. Now I'm able to view a web interface for the host.

The next step was to proceed with the VIRL installation. When purchasing my license I selected the VM option. The <a href=""http://virl-dev-innovate.cisco.com/"" target=""_blank"">VIRL website</a> has instructions for importing the OVA file using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client. I was able to follow the instructions for the vSphere client with only a few slight modifications:

Using the ESXi Host Client I was able to build the required port-groups (Flat, Flat1, SNAT, INT), however I had no options to enable promiscuous mode. I dug around the esxcli documentation and found out how to set this via ssh. I used SSH to connect to the host and issued the following commands (after creating the port-groups in the Host Client).
<pre><code>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat1
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p SNAT
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p INT</code></pre>
After doing so command <code>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security get -p Flat</code> or the Host Client will display the new, correct settings. 

I then proceeded to import the .ova file per the VIRL instructions. However, after a few failed attempts I finally noticed a message on the Host Client stating that if you're attempting to import an .OVA over 1gb, you should extract and import the individual .ovf and .vmdk files. So on my OSX terminal I issued the command <code>tar -zxvf virl.ova</code> and then repeated the process but instead of selecting the .ova file I selected the individually extracted files and the import job successfully completed.

Now I've got an ESXi host and a VIRL lab all of which I can manage from my MBA!",,

<pre><code>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat1
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p SNAT
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p INT</code></pre>
After doing so command <code>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security get -p Flat</code> or the Host Client will display the new, correct settings. 

I then proceeded to import the .ova file per the VIRL instructions. However, after a few failed attempts I finally noticed a message on the Host Client stating that if you're attempting to import an .OVA over 1gb, you should extract and import the individual .ovf and .vmdk files. So on my OSX terminal I issued the command <code>tar -zxvf virl.ova</code> and then repeated the process but instead of selecting the .ova file I selected the individually extracted files and the import job successfully completed.

12/18/2015 11:15,Installing Cisco VIRL with ESXi Host Client,"I recently gave away my last Windows PC and vowed never to return. As a result I'm left with a MacBook Air for our general home use. I've wanted to get a VIRL lab setup since I heard about it, I even purchased some modest hardware to use as a host. However I was hesitant to proceed with VIRL because I was concerned with being able to manage my lone ESXi host without a Windows PC to install the vSphere client. I recently learned about a great new tool to manage standalone ESXi servers, the <a href=""https://labs.vmware.com/flings/esxi-embedded-host-client"" target=""_blank"">ESXi Embedded Host Client</a>.

The host client is a VIB that you install directly on your ESXi host which offers a web interface to manage the host. You're able to configure most items on the host, access VM consoles, and some limited performance monitoring. It really is a great tool, however it doesn't have the full functionality that the vSphere client does. It is also only a Fling with VMware Labs, so its future is not certain. With this new tool I decided to plow along and get my VIRL lab up and running.

The first first issue I ran into was getting the ESXi .iso file onto a boot-able USB drive since my host hardware did not have an optical drive (neither does my MBA). The DiskUtility on OSX was recently changed with El Capitan so most of the how-to articles I found didn't apply or wouldn't fully function.

To get started I first installed ESXi (I used version 6 Update1). After the installation was completed I configured a static IP and enabled SSH. I then proceeded to install the ESXi Host Client VIB. The instructions are on the Host Client website. I used the SCP + SSH options to copy the file over and then execute the esxcli commands to install it. Now I'm able to view a web interface for the host.

The next step was to proceed with the VIRL installation. When purchasing my license I selected the VM option. The <a href=""http://virl-dev-innovate.cisco.com/"" target=""_blank"">VIRL website</a> has instructions for importing the OVA file using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client.

One last step, find the file <code>ISOLINUX.CFG</code> and rename it to <code>SYSLINUX.cfg</code>. Then edit the file and find the line that starts <code>APPEND -c boot.cfg</code> and append <code>-p 1</code> to the end. Save and Exit. You're ready to stick the USB drive in and boot the ESXi installer from USB.

I then installed ESXi (I used version 6 Update1). After the installation was completed I configured a static IP and enabled SSH. I then proceeded to install the ESXi Host Client VIB. The instructions are on the Host Client website. I used the SCP + SSH options to copy the file over and then execute the esxcli commands to install it. Now I'm able to view a web interface for the host.

The next step was to proceed with the VIRL installation. When purchasing my license I selected the VM option. The <a href=""http://virl-dev-innovate.cisco.com/"" target=""_blank"">VIRL website</a> has instructions for importing the OVA file using either the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client. I was able to follow the instructions for the vSphere client with only a few slight modifications:

Using the web client I was able to build the required port-groups (Flat, Flat1, SNAT, INT), however I had no options to enable promiscuous mode. I dug around the esxcli documentation and found out how to set this via ssh. I used SSH to connect to the host and issued the following commands (after creating the port-groups in the Host Client).
<code></code>
<pre>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p Flat1
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p SNAT
esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security set -o true -p INT</pre>
&nbsp;

<code></code>
After doing so command <code>esxcli network vswitch standard portgroup policy security get -p Flat</code> or the Host Client will display the new, correct settings. I then proceeded to import the .ova file per the VIRL instructions. However, after a few fialed attempts I finally noticed a message on the Host Client stating that if you're attempting to import an .OVA over 1gb, you should extract and import the individual .ovf and .vmdk files. So on my OSX terminal I issued the command <code>tar -zxvf virl.ova</code> and then repeated the process but instead of selecting the .ova file I selected the individually extracted files and the import job successfully completed.

12/18/2015 8:58,Installing Cisco VIRL with ESXi Host Client,"I recently gave away my last Windows PC and vowed never to return. As a result I'm left with a MacBook Air for our general home use. I've wanted to get a VIRL lab setup since I heard about it, I even purchased some modest hardware to use as a host. However I was hesitant to proceed with VIRL because I was concerned with being able to manage my lone ESXi host without a Windows PC to install the vSphere client. I recently learned about a great new tool to manage standalone ESXi servers, the <a href=""https://labs.vmware.com/flings/esxi-embedded-host-client"" target=""_blank"">ESXi Embedded Host Client</a>. 

The host client is a VIB that you install directly on your ESXi host which offers a web interface to manage the host. You're able to configure most items on the host, access VM consoles, and some limited performance monitoring. It really is a great tool, however it doesn't have the full functionality that the vSphere client does. It is also only a Fling with VMware Labs, so its future is not certain. With this new tool I decided to plow along and get my VIRL lab up and running. 

The first first issue I ran into was getting the ESXi .iso file onto a boot-able USB drive since my host hardware did not have an optical drive (neither does my MBA). The DiskUtility on OSX was recently changed with El Capitan so most of the how-to articles I found didn't apply or wouldn't fully function. I finally found a working solution from the <a href=""http://blog.macrepairsouthlondon.com/hardware/networking/create-esxi-usb-installer-mac-os-x/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Repairs London blog</a>. To summarize for posterity:
Format the USB drive using DiskUtility with FAT and a MBR.
Open the terminal and find the mount point of the USB drive
<code>diskutil list</code>
Then unmount the disk and use fdisk to mark the partition as bootable
<code>diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk#</code>
<code>fdisk -e /dev/disk#</code>
This enters fdisk interactive mode so enter the following commands to mark the partition and write the changes.<br>
<code><pre>f 1
write
quit</pre></code><br>

Originally designed to transport circuit mode communications and also primarily designed to transport real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice (encoded in PCM). SONET/SDH allowed for the transport many different circuits from different origins within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a communication protocol, it is a transport protocol. SONET is a set of transport containers that allow for delivery of a variety of protocols (ATM, Ethernet, TCP/IP)",,
11/4/2015 16:38,Routing Information Protocol,"RFC 1058 - Routing Information Protocol
RFC 1723 - RIP Version 2
RFC 2080 - RIPng for IPv6

Overview
All versions of RIP are considered distance vector protocols. Being a distance vector routing protocol, RIP utilizes hop-count as a base metric for route selection. When a router receives a routing update that includes a change to an entry it will update its routing table by increasing the hop-count by 1 and including the sender of the route as the next-hop. After updating its routing table the router will immediately send a routing update to the other RIP routers.

Communication
Both RIPv1 and RIPv2 utilize UDP port 520. RIPv1 communicates via the broadcast address and RIPv2 utilizes IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.9. RIPng utilizes UDP port 521 and communicates via the IPv6 Multicast address FF02::9.

I'm going to show how I use different Wordpress formatting to relay segments of code or commands in my posts. I normally write my posts using the plain 'Text' edit mode because I enjoy the simplicity and control.

The last bit of advice I would offer is that sometimes when I display a command syntax there are ""variable"" components to the command such as an interface name or a description. When I display something as variable I like to surround it with the &lt; and &gt; symbols. However since Wordpress is HTML based it assumes that text is an HTML tag and won't display it correctly.

9/20/2015 9:24,JUNOS VLANs and Trunking,"Today, I'm going to give a quick introduction to VLANs and trunking in JUNOS. VLANs in JUNOS work almost opposite like they do in IOS. You first create a VLAN with a vlan-name and then you assign a vlan-id (dot1q tag). By default all switch-ports are assigned to the 'default' vlan which is untagged (no vlan-id is assigned). 

To create a VLAN:
<pre><code>set vlans &lt;vlan-name&gt; vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre>

You then assign interfaces to a VLAN individually:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
vlan members &lt;vlan-name&gt;</code></pre>

Fairly straight-forward right? Now on to trunking, which differs a good bit from what we are used to with IOS. By default, JUNOS does not specify a native-vlan. Trunks, by default, do not support any (allow) any VLANs. Trunks also do no auto-negotiate by default. 

To set an interface as a trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
port-mode trunk</code></pre>
You can then either explicitly allow individual VLANs, or you can allow all VLANs on the trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
vlan members all</code></pre>

If you would like to trunk to a Cisco device, you must first create a ""native"" vlan (it would help to name it 'native') with a vlan-id of 1 (unless you've changed the native-vlan on the Cisco device). You can then specify the native-vlan on the trunk interface:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
native-vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre> 

I know that this does not appear to be a very easy way of assigning interfaces to VLANs, but at this point in my study it's all that I've got. I am going to do some more research into this, as I'm sure there is a more efficient way of doing things. ",,

5/9/2014 11:45,TCP 3-Way Handshake,"Dude 1: Hey, can we talk?
Dude 2: Yea, we can talk.
Dude 1: Cool.
<blockquote>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
-Albert Einstein</blockquote>
But in all technical seriousness, let's talk?ÿabout TCP. I think it's important for network engineers to understand TCP because it is one of the 2 protocols used for transport by higher level protocols such as HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc. Understanding that transport protocol can help when supporting other teams in your environment. Sometimes saying, ""well I can ping the server, it's not a network problem"" doesn't cut it, and that just encourages finger pointing. So after we have verified Layer 3 connectivity, we can start looking at troubleshooting Layer 4. This is usually best done with a packet capture, and where a good understanding of TCP can help.

If we break down troubleshooting Layer 4, and specifically TCP, the first thing that we need to verify is whether or not TCP is establishing 2-way communication between the end-hosts. TCP uses the famous 3-way handshake to establish this communication.

<code>SYN
SYN-ACK
ACK</code>

At the end of a successful handshake, a socket has been created and is used to transmit data. If there is a problem completing the handshake then the 2-way communication needs to be verified. TCP uses a similar, but 4-way, handshake to tear-down connections once the data transmission is complete:

Dude 1: Hey, I've got to run.
Dude 2: Ok, that's cool.
Dude 2: I'll see you later.
Dude 1: Bye.

We have a 4-way because both ends have to request (<code>FIN-ACK</code>) and agree (<code>ACK</code>) to tear down the connection. There are ways to cheat and end the connection sooner using <code>RST</code> flags, but that's not always ideal. So that's just a little about starting and tearing down TCP sessions, which can be helpful in troubleshooting TCP connectivity between end-hosts. In a future post I plan on writing a little more on the other TCP flags and maybe a post about performance issues.",,
9/20/2015 8:51,Debian 8 Xen Dom0,"Below are my living notes of how I installed Debian 8 as a Xen Dom0 (host).

Select language, host name, timezone and other settings

At Partition Disks, Select Manual and Continue. 
        I decided to go head and build 4 partitions from the beginning. If you're using a separate drive for storing the domU/guest drives then you could just use the 3. Or if you're more experienced you could use whichever layout you prefer.
Select SCSI1 (sda) or disk you're installing OS to and continue
	Select yes if asked to create a new partition table
sda1 - Select the pri/log FREE SPACE and Continue
	Create a new partition and Continue
		New partition size: 200 MB and Continue
		Select Primary and Continue
		Select Beginning and Continue
		Double-click Use as: and set to  Ext2
		Double-click Mount point and select '/boot - the static files of the boot loader'
		Double-click Bootable flag to set to on
		Select Done setting up the partition and Continue

1/11/2011 8:26,New Year and New Beginnings,"I feel blessed to be kicking off 2011 with a fresh start at a new company. It's felt like a crazy few weeks going through the interview process and then the transition between companies. I thought I should take a minute to reflect back on the experience and share any insights I came across.
<ul>
	<li>Have a clean simple resume, and bring a copy with you to the interview. I brought a notebook (professional looking) with me to take notes of peoples names, responsibilities, and notes when considering a possible offer.</li>
	<li>Don't lie. If you're unfamiliar with a topic or technology, don't be afraid to say so. If you want to save face you could say, ""I'm not familiar with technology X, but I have experience with Y which is a similar technology."" However if you don't know something, you don't know something. It's not the end of the world.</li>
	<li>Have a bio for yourself. This is one I stumbled through and wish I was more prepared for. When asked, ""Tell me a little about your past experience"", you should have a well thought out answer. We all know what we've done at our past jobs, we wrote it down in our resumes, but did you rehearse speaking out loud a quick bio? It would be best to customize or tweak this bio to highlight your strengths that match with the opportunities' position requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask questions. If you're genuinely interested in an opportunity, I believe it will show in your curiosity to learn about the organization and the position requirements. A few things to consider include: the organizational structure of the company and more importantly the IT department, current coworkers that you would be working alongside with, and any future plans or projects in the works.</li>
</ul>

11/6/2013 20:23,Goals,"I used to have a goal in life. Not that I don't have goals anymore, but in this case, I am referring to a specific goal. I had an goal of a job/career that I wanted to do. And lately in my life I've become frustrated because I felt like I've been straying away from this goal, this end-state that I desired. I wanted to be a fancy, big-shot, network engineer. I wanted to work for a big company, maybe do a little traveling, and generally be somebody important. 

But what I've started to realize as I've come a few steps closer to that goal was that I didn't like the life that surrounded it. I'm not comfortable with a lot of travel, I'm not willing to relocate, and I don't like the idea of the long hours it would take to reach that goal. And that was making me mad. I was mad and upset because I wasn't reaching my goal, even though I didn't like the life it required. This has really been bothering me for some time. I was wanting to do X, but felt stuck doing Y, and I was frustrated.

But I just read <a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/11/04/hunter-s-thomspon-letters-of-note-advice/"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>. And it struck me that what I've been doing is actually a much better thing. That article discusses a letter Hunter S. Thompson wrote regarding how to find meaning in your life. And what the author,  Maria Popova, discusses in that article and Thompson's letter is the subject of fixed goals. You set a fixed goal in life, yet you are not in a fixed position in life; your perspective is constantly changing. When you focus on a fixed goal such as a career, you are going to be forced to mold yourself around that goal, changing who you are to achieve that fixed target. 

Hunter S. Thompson purposes that it is much better to focus on being yourself. Focus on the life you want to live, and pick goals that are aligned with that life. I'm not saying that changing yourself to reach a goal is a bad thing. Without that change, we would have no self improvement. What I am saying is do not try to force yourself into a mold just because it looks cool, or it's what everyone says you should do. Focus on the life you want, pick goals in line with that, and you will be much happier. For me, I don't want to relocate to a big city, I don't want to travel (a lot), I want flexibility to maintain a healthy work-life balance, I want to serve my Church and spend time with my family. If that means I can't have that fancy job, so be it. I don't want the life that goes with that decision. I'll pick a new goal, aligned with the life I want.",,
8/2/2011 20:14,Work-Life Balance,"In the past few months I've graduated college, started a new job, achieved the next technical certification, but most importantly I've become a father. Each day I barely have time to catch my breath before I wake up and start all over. Becoming a father has caused me to pause and re-assess my situation, to re-evaluate my priorities. I began to think about this ""work-life balance"" and just how crazy the notion is. Since when did work start competing with <strong>LIFE</strong>? Life is the only real thing. Our families and living should not be competing with <em>work</em> for our time and attention. I don't just mean that we should just be focusing more on our families, but we should also be taking care of ourselves, both physically and spiritually. We all know that sitting in a chair from 8-5 isn't exactly improving our physique. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that work isn't important, or that we shouldn't strive to be the best at whatever it is we choose to do. What I am saying is that we should not forget the reason why we are working.

Enjoy life.

&lt;Insert Useless App Here&gt; Wants to Send You Push Notifications.

No. No more notifications. No more alerts. No more pop-ups. No more stealing my attention!

My time is valuable, very valuable. I have a wife and 2 year old son who love me very much (and I them.) When you are at work 8-9 hours out of the day, the time spent with your family, <strong>should be spent focusing on your family</strong>. I have a job to do so I can provide for my family, I should be focusing on completing my tasks not constantly checking my inbox. I came to the realization this morning just how often my phone beeps or I go check my inbox; and I interrupt life to divert my attention to something that honestly is not important. My family, loved ones, and people in general deserve more than interruptions. Heck, even the task that I should be doing now deserves more focus than the constant interruptions I submit myself to. If I'm constantly checking my phone, or my email, or whatever feed, I am diverting from attention from what really matters in life.

This realization has been some time coming. I was driving the other day when I noticed a little boy riding his bike on the side walk, a few feet behind him trailed his mom. Focused entirely on her cell phone. It looked sad. The little boy looked like he was having a great time riding his bike, but his mom seemed to be paying no attention that excitement. What a shame it is that we can't focus on the here and now. Or maybe people are trying to focus on the here and now, but looking in the wrong places. Do I want my son to grow up having to constantly fight for attention with a cell phone?! Absolutely not.

I'm done with it. I'm done with the white noise stealing my attention from what really matters. Today I'm turning off all the notifications on my phone. I will not be constantly checking my email, or Twitter, or Facebook. I'm not saying I'm throwing my phone out the window or ignoring email, but when it's time to be with my family, or time to get a job done, or even interacting with the cashier at the coffee shop... I will be focusing on what really matters.",,
4/6/2011 18:30,Why I'm Considering Quitting Twitter,"I have recently really let my Twitter participation fall by the waste side. This has left me feeling left out and somewhat out of touch. I really enjoyed Twitter because it was almost real time, and talking to other engineers as opposed to just reading white papers has been highly motivating. I would like to hear back from people to see if I'm totally off base or really justified. 

1. I can't keep up. I follow a little over 100 people and find it almost impossible, even when I give Twitter my full attention, to keep up with the really interesting conversations. I try to follow those who follow me, but I feel like it's getting out of hand. If I do decide to stay on Twitter I will have to do some serious pruning of e people I follow.

2. It is harder to stay connected at my new job. I started a new job this January that has a very high awareness of security. I'm unable to install unapproved software on my work desktop, and Twitter online is difficult to manage for serious twitter users. That leaves my cell phone for access, and trying to keep an eye on interesting tweets when I can only view 4 at a time is even more difficult.  Which leads me to my next point...

3. Twitter really is a distraction. As much as I do see a benefit in Twitter I have noticed an increase in productivity at work since my above point has forced me to limit my use. I'm not going to say Twitter use is a negative but I have seen how it's not quite a productivity multiplier. 

4. I also feel like I am now more motivated to use other forms of communication such as email, forums, and my blog. Keeping in mind my point number 3, I still need to be careful as forums and blogs can be just as distracting as my Twitter stream. I feel like I need to fill that social void that Twitter has left with other forms of communication.  I have really been working on some new articles I hope to publish soon.

So I'm considering either doing some serious trimming of who I follow, or just doing away with Twitter altogether. I am leaning toward the side of just calling it quits so I don't feel any temptation to dive head first back into my Twitter stream.

Thoughts, or good riddance?

&lt;Insert Useless App Here&gt; Wants to Send You Push Notifications.

No. No more notifications. No more alerts. No more pop-ups. No more stealing my attention!

My time is valuable, very valuable. I have a wife and 2 year old son who love me very much (and I them.) When you are at work 8-9 hours out of the day, the time spent with your family, <strong>should be spent focusing on your family</strong>. I have a job to do so I can provide for my family, I should be focusing on completing my tasks not constantly checking my inbox. I came to the realization this morning just how often my phone beeps or I go check my inbox; and I interrupt life to divert my attention to something that honestly is not important. My family, loved ones, and people in general deserve more than interruptions. Heck, even the task that I should be doing now deserves more focus than the constant interruptions I submit myself to. If I'm constantly checking my phone, or my email, or whatever feed, I am diverting from attention from what really matters in life.

This realization has been some time coming. I was driving the other day when I noticed a little boy riding his bike on the side walk, a few feet behind him trailed his mom. Focused entirely on her cell phone. It looked sad. The little boy looked like he was having a great time riding his bike, but his mom seemed to be paying no attention that excitement. What a shame it is that we can't focus on the here and now. Or maybe people are trying to focus on the here and now, but looking in the wrong places. Do I want my son to grow up having to constantly fight for attention with a cell phone?! Absolutely not.

9/3/2014 12:29,Cleaning Things Up,"This has been something I've been trying to do for quite a while. I have my registered domain name that I use for my personal blog, which originally started as a primarily networking (IT related) blog. I wouldn't consider it popular by any means, yet it does get some traffic. So when I would write a non-networking related post, it felt quite out of place. I went back and forth on whether or not to break these out into separate sites, but I always felt like I wanted to keep them under my ""umbrella"".

What this boils down to is that I am a real live person (a single entity), and my domain name is reflective of that. However, I have multiple roles, I'm a husband, a father, I have a job (""professional"" is debatable), I have other business ventures, hobbies, etc. I've wanted to separate these things because I don't think that people reading about my coffee shop ventures are interested in the latest technology Cisco has to offer. I used Wordpress.org as the platform for this site and I debated between separate sites (installs), Wordpress MultiSite, and just using plain categories. I like and have used the categories, but I still felt like it wasn't separated enough for my tastes and I didn't like the robertjuric.com/category/whatever URL format. Then I ready an article about custom post types, and I was enlightened.

Custom post types are a way to customize Wordpress into doing things it was never conceived to do. I've seen them used in Wordpress plugins so instead of just posts and pages, you can have custom types for instance called books, players, teams, events, etc. What I like about this is the shortened URL (robertjuric.com/networking/) as well as the separate management of the different posts types. The All Posts menu only shows my normal ""posts"" I have a separate menu for ""networking"" and ""code"".
<h3>How I'm Doing It</h3>
Plugins, Home Page, Firehose

Creating custom post types is done in code, and can be done with a very quick and simple custom plugin. I decided to look around and settled on the existing <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/types/"" target=""_blank"">Types plugin</a>. It was very simple to install and then I just?ÿadded Custom Post Types for each of my desired categories. One thing I noticed was the whole singular/plural thing. Since networking isn't really a noun it was hard to pluralize, so what I did was add 'post' to the name, but I left the slug what I desired the URL to be. For instance, my networking Custom Post Type is?ÿcalled ""Network Post"", ""Network Posts"", and ""networking"" is the slug. Then I would check all of the 'Display Sections' so that I could turn off comments, or set a featured image.

That was great, now I have a custom spot on my single blog/domain name to separate my different roles. But I've had this blog for a few years now, how do I pull all of my old 'posts' into the new custom post types I've created? Enter the fairly obvious plugin?ÿ<a href=""http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/"" target=""_blank"">Post Type Switcher</a>. This plugin adds a setting to the Edit and Quick Edit screens to configure which post type the post belongs to. What I did, since I already had my different posts assigned to different categories, was view all the posts in a category and bulk edit them to change the post type.

The next thing I had to do update my themes functions.php to show the custom post types on the home page. If you really wanted to keep things separate you could skip this step, and I'm probably going roll this back on my current home page as I get more generic content added to my primary blog. All you have to do is add this code to your themes function.php file. Just replace the ""slug#"" with the slugs you configured on your custom post types.

<code>// Added for custom post types, Show posts of 'post', 'slug1' and 'slug2' post types on home page
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'add_my_post_types_to_query' );
function add_my_post_types_to_query( $query ) {
if ( is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() )
$query-&gt;set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'slug1', 'slug2', 'slug3' ) );
return $query;
}</code>
<h3>Menu and?ÿRSS Feeds</h3>
The next thing I wanted to do was make it easier for any readers I had left with an easy way to select which content that they wanted to view. What I have done is created a widget with simple URLs to the RSS feeds for each of my custom post types. This was quite easy to do by creating links to the feeds with this URL format: <code>http://example.com/feed/?post_type[]=slug1</code>

To get the menu items to appear I had to create custom URL menu items with links to the slugs (robertjuric.com/slug1).
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
If you get creative you can really do some cool things with Wordpress and Custom Post Types. Well this was meant to be a quick introduction to Custom Post Types and I hope it served that purpose. It also is the final nail in the coffin of my different roles/sites. So if you're one of my fellow network geeks, update your RSS feeds so you stay up to date with my mediocre technical blogging.",,
12/18/2011 19:52,Perl Beginnings,"After reading some advice from some very smart people, I've decided to try my hand at learning a scripting language to aid in my network administration tasks. After some quick searching I've decided to learn Perl. From what I've gathered it has strong text manipulation capabilities which will come in handy parsing device configs or SNMP/SSH responses. I'm not going to attempt to teach programming basics, but what I hope to cover will be some useful examples and building blocks that we can use as network administrators.

For my scripting setup I will be focusing on a Windows perspective. Instead of using <a href=""http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads"" target=""_blank"">ActivePerl</a> I decided to use <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cygwin</a> and the Perl modules, so hopefully most of what I write will also apply to *nix users. I'm also using <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a> for my editing/coding, but you could also use the default Windows Notepad or if you want to be hardcore, Cygwin and VIM. I may include some VIM tips/shortcuts in future posts.

My first Perl script is not ""Hello, World"", but instead a simple Ping script. I used <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/Net/Ping.html"" target=""_blank"">Net::Ping</a> to conduct a simple ICMP Ping and then output the results. The example I first used had a hard-coded variable for the host, which I left commented out for reference purposes. Instead, I added a line to receive a command line argument for the host variable.
<pre>use Net::Ping;
use strict;

#Setting a variable
#my $host = ""www.google.com"";

#Using an arguement
my $host = ""$ARGV[$0]"";
my $pingobj = Net::Ping-&gt;new('icmp');
my ($status,$time,$ip) = $pingobj-&gt;ping($host);

if ($status) {
print ""Host $host ($ip) responded in $time secondsn"";
} else {
print ""Host $host ($ip) unreachablen"";
}
</pre>
Voila!

3/17/2014 10:18,Using GitHub,"Not much has left me with more confusion on how I should use a tool than GitHub. I've banged my head and messed up my repository (I'll explain soon) more times than I can count. Until I read the 5 minute <a href=""http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/"" target=""_blank"">Understanding the GitHub Workflow</a> guide. Wow I should have just read that on the front end....

My summary of how to use GitHub (high-level):
<code>1. Create a repository
2. Create a branch of that repository
(Write code)
3. Commit changes to branch
4. Push changes to remote repository
5. Merge branch into master</code>

GitHub is based on Git, a?ÿ<em>distributed?ÿ</em>revision control system.?ÿSo you have your GitHub account online, and then you install Git on your local machine to do your coding. Those are two separate repositories (I didn't realize this at first). When you make commit changes on your local machine, you are committing them to your local repository, which is why #4 is required to push those changes to the remote repository (distribution!).

Branches are also important, because the master branch is supposed to be your deployable code. If you are going to work on a new feature, you should create a branch to work on that feature, commit changes to it, and then if it tests out ok, merge the branch back with the primary.

That's GitHub in a nutshell. There is soo much more, such as collaboration, issue tracking, mark-up, forks, but this is good enough to get you started. We can look at adding this additional features as the need arises. For now let's get started coding!",,
3/17/2014 9:50,Mmm Code,"I remember some of my first computers. I remember an old Apple IIe with a 5 1/4 floppy my Dad brought home from his work. I remember that one of the applications I had for said computer was Apple BASIC. I don't really know how I became interested in writing applications/coding, but from a pretty early age I was hooked. I went from Apple BASIC to MS BASIC to Visual Basic. I never learned official structures or programming methodologies, I never even took a Computer Science course in school. But I liked to build things, I like to solve puzzles, and programming met those needs. Yet somewhere along the way I lost touch. ?ÿWhen I entered the workforce, I got into Enterprise IT, and got dirty keeping a business' technology needs running, but I stopped building things. I think this left me a little empty.

Recently, without much explanation, I've rekindled that fire, that desire to create. I've been doing a lot of research on some of the latest languages and after much deliberation I decided to pickup Node.js for it's fast IO handling. With my background in Enterprise IT, I thought I could use it to build a quick and dirty Syslog server. It would be a good example that would let me get my hands dirty coding again, and it met an actual need that I have. I shall call it, Sysive (Syslog Archive).

So where do I put my code? I don't think that old 5 1/4 floppy is going to cut it anymore. Github seems to be the defacto standard for sharing and working on code. More on using Github in my next post...",,
3/24/2014 9:08,Git Lessons Learned,"Wow, Git can get out of hand quickly. I thought I'd share some of my lessons learned from actually using Git since my last <a href=""http://robertjuric.com/2014/03/17/using-github/"" target=""_blank"">Using GitHub post</a>.

<strong>Do no track large files, such as /data/</strong>
My app started out simple enough, but then I installed MongoDB, and maybe through sheer ignorance I decided to install the data folder in the same folder as my repository. Well I added the folder to the repository and committed. When I tried to push I found out there is a file size limit. Live and learn.

<strong>Can use exlude file to ignore those folders, or place data in other folder</strong>
So I'm not sure if you're supposed to include the node modules in the repository or not, but to avoid the non-tracking errors you can just stop tracking them in the exclude file.

<strong>Use 'git status' to make sure no local commits haven't been pushed</strong>
After I committed my too large data/ folder, I tried to push to the remote repo. I didn't noticed that it failed. I continued making commits until I caught my error 4 commits in. If I had checked the git status I could have caught the error and resolved it much easier than being 4 commits in.

<strong>Conflicts suck, commit and push regularly, check status often</strong>
Biggest lesson learned right here. Resolving conflicts or correcting a mistake is a huge headache, one best just avoided. Commit often, push after commits, and check status to verify.

<strong>CLI &gt; GUI</strong>
This one is probably obvious to most, but since I come from a Windows background I started out trying to use the GUI. Luckily I'm a network engineer by day and I feel at home on the CLI. It doesn't take long to learn the CLI syntax and then you have much better control of Git.

Here are some of the Git commands I use quite often. This may well just be a future reference for myself:
<code>//Remove file from tracking but keep actual file
git rm --cached file.txt</code>

<code>//Create branch
git checkout -b Branch-Name</code>

<code>//Commit, force add files, comment
git commit -a -m 'Commit comment'</code>

<code>//Push to remote branch
git push origin Branch-Name</code>

<code>//Merging a branch:
//Move back to the master branch
git checkout master
//Merge master with branch
git merge Branch-Name
//Delete local branch
git branch -d Branch-Name
//Push to local, merged, master to remote master
git push origin master
//Delete remote branch
git push origin :Branch-Name</code>

So there you have it, Git isn't as simple as it first appears. However, it can be easy enough if you follow some simple rules and pay attention to what you're doing. If I run into anything else I'll be sure to write that up as well. These posts tend to usually be references for myself anyway.",,

1/29/2010 8:37,Solarwinds Certified Professional,"I took the Solarwinds Certified Professional (SCP) exam yesterday; I passed! There is not much study material for the exam, so I thought I would share a few things that stood out to me.

I feel I am strong in the basic network management principles, and I've been using Solarwinds for almost 2 years now, so most of the basic and Solarwinds usage questions I was able to answer without much thought. There was one question concerning configuring syslog to send messages on OSPF updates that I felt inadequate to answer. A majority of questions that really stood out to me were regarding how to size Orion; when to upgrade your SQL server, how to size licensing, whether to use a distributed or central management system, etc.

I don't want to share too much information, so I'll leave you with this:
<ul>
	<li>Know the network management protocols and how to use them for troubleshooting</li>

I've been preparing mostly by reading, practicing subnetting, and practicing on the exam simulator. I went yesterday morning to take my exam... and passed!! I'm now a full CCNA! I am still excited and I feel like I have had a large burden taken off my shoulders.

I thought I would share a few quick tips, or at least things that helped me study:
<ul>
	<li>Subnetting - Practice, Practice, Practice
I study subnetting in two ways: memorizing my chart and then practicing to find the subnet address. For the ICND2 or CCNA exam, I would recommend adding the wildcard masks as a column to remember, it might come in handy. I practiced writing my chart top to bottom, left to right, and then backwards just to make sure I knew it. I timed myself a few days before the exam to see how long it took me to copy the entire chart /20 - /30, it only took me about 2 minutes. That makes it well worth it to write down the chart once the exam begins to have as a reference later.
I also practiced subnetting by practicing finding the subnet address and the range for that subnet. I found a great site online that provides random practice problems <a href=""http://faculty.valleycollege.net/rpowell/jscript/subnet2.htm"">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Exam Simulator
I also spent a good bit of time on the exam simulator trying to answer the study questions. Honestly as I was using the exam simulator I didn't do as well as I had hoped and was nervous about taking my real exam. However, the questions on the actual exam seemed to be a little easier, so after taking the exam I felt exam simulator did a great job of helping me to prepare.</li>
	<li>Real-World Experience
I have to say real-world experience is invaluable on the exam. I had already configured VLANs and ACLs and spent some time with STP so I felt comfortable with those questions. The company I work for utilizes a MPLS network and we only have a few legacy frame relay circuits still alive, so those questions seemed to prove the most difficult for me.</li>
</ul>
I would like to encourage anyone else wanting to take CCNA exam to go ahead and schedule the exam, study hard, and just do it.",,
2/4/2010 16:45,STP Notes,"Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents switched loops from occurring in redundant topologies by placing ports in either a Forwarding (alive) state or a Blocking (dead) state. STP makes changes to port states based on topology changes as necessary, allowing for redundant links to be brought up and down as necessary.

Terms:
<ul>
	<li>Root Switch - Lowest Bridge ID; All ports forwarding</li>
	<li>Root Port - On non-root switches, the port with the lowest admin cost to root switch</li>
	<li>Designated Bridge -Lowest cost switch to the root switch on an Ethernet segment</li>
	<li>Designated Port - Port connecting the designated bridge to the segment</li>
	<li>STP Bridge ID (BID) - Unique ID of each switch composed of a priority field and system ID</li>
	<li>Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) - messages that switches use to exchange info with each other</li>
	<li>Hello BPDU - Lists the sending switch's BID, the current root switch's BID, Cost to reach the root switch, and timer values of the root switch</li>
</ul>
Process:
<ol>
	<li>Elect a Root Switch</li>
	<li>Select Switch Root Port</li>
	<li>Select Switch Designated Port</li>
	<li>(All other ports are placed in a Blocking State)</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">1. Electing a Root Switch
Each switch begins by sending out it's Hello BPDUs with its own BID listed as the root switch. If a switch encounters a Hello BPDU with a lower root BID, called a Superior Hello, then it acknowledges that switch as the root switch, stops originating Hellos, and begins forwarding the Superior Hello modified to include the correct sender BID and new root BID. This process continues until all switches in the topology agree on a single root switch.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">2. Selecting a Switch's Root Port
The root port is the switch port with the lowest STP cost to reach the root switch. A switch calculates each port cost by adding the advertised cost, which was received in the Hello BPDU, to the interface cost, which is configured on the switch.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">3. Selecting a Switch's Designated Port
When a non-root switch forwards a Hello BPDU, it includes it's cost to the root switch. The switch port with the lowest advertised cost to the root on a segment is the Designated Port. If the advertised costs are tied the switch with lower BID wins and is the Designated Port.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:60px;"">Default Port Costs:
10 Mbps - 100
100 Mbps - 19
1 Gbps - 4
10 Gbps - 2</p>
So far I've described the process by which STP creates it's initial topology. As part of a continual process the root switch sends out a Hello, by default, every 2 seconds with a cost of 0. Other switches will receive this Hello on their Root Ports, change the sender's BID, update the cost-to-root, and forward the Hello out their Designated Ports.

When a switch either does not receive a Hello by the MaxAge time-out, or it's Root Port goes down, the switch begins the whole process over in order to determine if it's the Root Switch, and if not, what ports should be the RP and DP. The entire process for an interface to move from a Blocking State to a Forwarding state could take up to 50 seconds as it waits for the MaxAge time-out (10x Hello timer or 20 seconds by default), waits 30 seconds in Listening and Learning states, before arriving at a Forwarding state.

2/12/2010 19:45,STP Configuration,"This is a brief overview of the commands necessary to properly setup STP

1. Set STP Mode
<em>(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst</em>

2. Influence STP Topology - Specify Root and Secondary Switches
<em>(config)# spanning-tree vlan </em><em>vlan-id root primary</em>
Tells the switch to use pick a priority value, for the specified VLAN, that will force the switch to become the root switch. The same command can be given as 'root secondary' to specify the backup switch. You can also use <em>spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt; priority &lt;#&gt; </em>command to modify the base priority, however it is preferred to specify the root switch.

3. Influence STP Topology - Influence RP Selection
If you have two links to the root switch, port cost will decide which becomes the root port. Since port cost is by default based on bandwidth, when there is a tie it is decided by the lowest MAC address. You can influence this decision by manually lowering the port cost on the port you would like to be used as the root port:
<em>(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt; cost &lt;#&gt;</em>

*When setting the root switch or port costs you can either use the 'vlan <em>vlan-id</em>' command or omit it and apply the changes to all VLANs.

4. Enable Other Features
On switch ports that will only be used as access ports it is best to configure PortFast and BPDU Guard:
<em>(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
(config-if)# spanning-tree bpdu guard enable
</em>You can<em> </em>also specify BPDU guard to be on by default any time PortFast is enabled with the global command:
<em>(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default</em>
When BPDU guard finds a problem it will disable the port until you manually reset it. To have the port reenable itself use errdisable recovery:
<em>(config)# errdisable recovery cause bpduguard</em>
The default timeout is 300 seconds, you can modify this setting with:
<em>(config)# errdisable recovery interval &lt;###&gt;</em>

Below are some default settings and the commands to modify them:
<table border=""1"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Setting</td>
<td>Default</td>
<td>Commands</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bridge ID</td>
<td>Priority + MAC</td>
<td>spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> root {primary | secondary}
spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> priority <em>priority</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interface Cost</td>
<td>100Mbps=19, 1Gbps=4, 10Gbps=2</td>
<td>spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> cost <em>cost</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Port Fast</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>spanning-tree portfast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BPDU Guard</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>spanning-tree bpduguard enable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
To alleviate some of the need for STP, but still retain port failure high availability you can configure ports in EtherChannels with multiple interfaces added to a port channel:
<em>(config-if)# channel-group &lt;group#&gt; mode on</em>

And finally some helpful debug and show commands:
<em>show spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt;</em><em>
show spanning-tree summary totals
show etherchannel &lt;#&gt; summary
debug spanning-tree events</em>

2/10/2010 22:04,STP Notes Continued,"STP, RSTP, PVST+, RPVST

STP (802.1d) - Spanning Tree Protocol - Covered <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/stp-notes/"">Here</a>

RSTP (802.1w) - Rapid STP
Improves convergence times by reducing waiting times when reacting to changes in topology. Renames port states to Discarding, Learning, and Forwarding. Implements a feature to characterize connectivity methods called either Link-type (Switch-to-Switch) or Edge-type(Switch-to-Device). Adds additional port roles to include Root Port, Designated Port, Alternate Port (like a backup RP), Backup Port (when 2 links exist in the same collision domain), and Disabled port (shutdown ports). In RSTP, instead of waiting to forward Hello BPDUs from the root switch, switches independently create Hello BPDUs.

PVST+, PVRST or RPVST
Allows creation of spanning trees for each VLAN. By doing so you are able to load-balance VLANs across trunks by setting different port costs for the different VLAN spanning-trees. The ability to create separate spanning trees for each VLAN is made possible by extending the Bridge ID. As I noted earlier the Bridge ID is made up of a priority and part of the MAC address. PVST and RPVST go a step further and extend the priority field into a smaller priority field and a System ID field which holds the VLAN ID. This will create a different BID for each VLAN.",,

Let's look at this from bottom to the top:

Layer 1 of the OSI Model gives us 10GE or 10 Gigabit Ethernet. 10GE is standardized as IEEE 802.3-2008 which covers the various physical layer flavors such as 10GBASE-SR.

Layer 2 defines our Data Link protocols such as FiberChannel and Ethernet; we'll focus on the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet has been stretched out to cover many various enhancements under IEEE 802.1. In the converged data center network there is a demand for improvements over our standard ""lossy"" Ethernet. This is where DCB, or Data Center Bridging, comes into play. DCB is a collection of enhancements to the 802.1 Ethernet standard that can transform Ethernet to ""lossless"". These enhancements include 802.1Qau, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. Fore more information on these enhancements check out the<a href=""http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/dcbridges.html"" target=""_blank""> IEEE DCB Task Group</a>. DCB is the term for these enhancements used by the IEEE. DCE, or Data Center Ethernet, is Cisco's trademarked term based on these enhancements. CEE, or Converged Enhanced Ethernet, is trademarked by IBM and used by companies such as Juniper. I think it is important to note that while all of these terms mean the same thing, none have been ratified as a standard.

Layer 3 is where FCoE, or Fiber Channel over Ethernet, calls home. FCoE is the encapsulation of Fiber Channel frames into Ethernet frames. Because Fiber Channel is a loss-less protocol it requires the enhancements to Ethernet as found in DCB. One important item to note is that because FCoE lives at Layer 3 it is not able to route across IP networks.

I threw iSCSI in there where it lives in Layer 5 so that you can see how iSCSI traffic is able to route across our IP networks. Hopefully seeing this drawn out based on OSI layers can give you a better grasp of the technologies and their buzzwords.

*Disclaimer: I am by no means any time of expert in these matters. These postings are mainly for my own benefit so that I can better understand what I'm working with.",,
6/22/2010 20:30,HWIC-3G-CDMA-V Notes,"I deployed our first 3G enabled router on the Verizon network last week. Configuring the CDMA HWIC is similar to configuring the GSM, except for the fact that I had to activate the modem first. With the GSM HWIC I was able to insert an already active SIM card and start running. The CDMA does not use a SIM card and has to use either OTA (Over The Air) or manual activation. To activate the CDMA modem I first ran a '<em>show cellular 0/0/0 radio</em>' to verify I had a signal and <em>'show cellular 0/0/0 network'</em> to discover the SID (SystemID) and the NID (NetworkID) of the network.?ÿ The command to perform manual activation is:

<em>cellular slot/wic_slot/port cdma  activate manual mdn msid sid nid msl</em>

For the MDN and MSDIN I used the 10 digit telephone number. The SID and NID can be found in the show radio command and for the MSL I just used '0'.

Once activation was complete I was ready to roll. One thing I noticed was when I tried to run the chat script to reduce network attach time, the script failed out. I have not had any problems with network attach times with this CDMA HWIC. Also, because of my newly learned EasyVPN skills, no static IP addresses or static IP tunnels were necessary to get this site online. I have to say coupled with EasyVPN, this is starting to become a more easily deploy-able solution. I hope that the 3G technology can meet our business needs, as it would provide much greater flexibility

Edit/Update 7/27/2010:

I just attempted to activate another HWIC-3G-CDMA-V, but on a new IOS version, and I found out the command has changed somewhat. I was running Adv. Security 15.0(1)M2. The command was:

<em>cellular 0/0/0 activate manual mdn msid msl</em>

Again the MDN and the MSID are basically the 10-digit mobile number number and I used '0' for the Verizon MSL.",,

3/1/2010 20:44,HWIC-3G-GSM - Network Attach Time,"As of last week I now have two 3G cellular enabled routers running two different plants. One painful issue we experienced with our first installation was the long network attach time, or the time for the HWIC to get a signal. In the case of a power outage, or router reload, the time for the card to find a signal again was painfully slow. After a few incidents and much research I finally found in the Cisco documentation stating for North American installs you should run a one-time CHAT script to narrow the network search range to North American Bands only. I experimented with this CHAT script on my second install and saw a major improvement. I then went back and ran the script on my first installation with the same results. I feel that it is safe now to add to my list of documentation.

For the initial configuration notes see my original post <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/hwic-3g-gsm/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

<em>(config#) chat-script prl """" ""at"" TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" AT!ENTERCND=""A710"" TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" AT!CUSTOM=""PRLREGION"",02 TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" ""AT!RESET""</em>

<em>(config#) debug chat</em>

<em>(config#) start-chat prl 0/0/0</em>

<em>(config#) int cellular 0/0/0
(config-if#) no shutdown
(config-if#) exit</em>

The first part of this snippet creates the script. We then shut down the cellular interface. Turn on CHAT debugging so we can verify that the script is applied successfully. Run the script, and after verification, bring the interface back up. Be sure to do a <em>'no debug all' </em>to turn off debugging.

9/22/2010 13:02,JUNOS Firewall Filters - Part 2,"As promised I'm following up with my <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/junos-firewall-filters/"">previous post</a> regarding firewall filters and writing about implementing firewall filters. 

A brief recap: there are 3 different types of firewall filters available in JUNOS: port, vlan, and router (layer3). These are configured under the appropriate family (inet or ethernet-switching) in the FIREWALL hierarchy. The filters contain terms (up to 2048 of them) which are built like if/then statements which contain match conditions (the <i>if</i> part) and actions (the <i>then</i> part). Now let's get to it.

<b>Applying Port Filters:</b>
<pre>interfaces {
   &lt;interface name&gt; {
      unit 0 {
         family ethernet-switching {
            filter input &lt;filtername&gt;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>
Notice that, as mentioned in my previous post, port filters are only able to be applied to ingress traffic on L2 interfaces.

<b>Applying Router (Layer 3) Filters:</b>
<pre>interfaces {
   &lt;interface name&gt; {
      unit 0 {
         family inet {
            filter &#91;input/ouput&#93; &lt;filtername&gt;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>
Note here the option to filter on ingress or egress traffic of the L3 interface. It's also the same setup as a Port filter, but applied at the <i>inet</i> family instead of <i>ethernet-switching</i>.

<b>Applying VLAN Filters:</b>
<pre>vlans {
   &lt;vlan name&gt; {
      filter &#91;input/ouput&#93; &lt;filtername&gt;
   }
}</pre>

A quick word on processing order, when processing Layer 2 packets(switched), the firewall filters are applied in this order:
1. Ingress Port
2. Ingress VLAN
3. Egress VLAN

When processing Layer 3 packets (routed), the firewall filters are applied in this order:
1. Ingress Port
2. Ingress VLAN
3. Ingress Router
4. Egress Router
5. Egress VLAN

I failed to mention this in my previous post, but if you're unhappy with how the terms are arranged in a filter, (since they are processed in order) you can simply re-arrange them instead of rewriting the entire filter:
<pre>
&#91;edit firewall filter family inet filter dummyfilter&#93;
root@switch# insert term &lt;term1&gt; before term &lt;term2&gt;
</pre>

Well that wraps it up for firewall filters. I sit for the JNCIA-EX exam next week, so you can expect to see a handful of basic switching posts coming soon.",,
7/1/2010 10:19,Data Center Move,"I was trying to think of my next blog post and I was running out of ideas when it hit me that we're moving data centers! Not only are we moving data centers, we are collapsing two data centers into a single data center through virtualization. We are also spinning off a division of our company as a standalone entity with it's own infrastructure.

To bring you up to speed, we are breaking this into 4 large projects: 1. Setting up the new data center infrastructure for both companies. 2. Moving the spin-off company to their new data center. 3. Collapsing/moving the Southern data center to the new data center, and then finally 4. Moving the main data center. We currently have about 70 physical servers and 70 virtual servers. We are a VMWare shop and plan on either P2V'ing the physical servers or just rebuilding them as virtual and migrating data, when all is said and one we are expecting to have around 200-250 virtual machines and are not expecting to run into any machines that we can't virtualize.

We started out with the idea of building out our own data center, but when we got down to engineering it out at our location, cooling costs were going to blow our budget. Also, because we are a relatively small IT department we weren't too excited about having to manage the cooling, power, generators, etc. which eventually led us to look for hosted racks at a larger provider.

So far we have been spending most of this year researching vendors and trying to design our brand-new data center. We have been researching SANs, switches, backup solutions, VMWare, servers. So much stuff in such a short period of time that my head hurts at times. But what a great learning experience, one that I hope to share with you as we progress through this project.",,
9/26/2010 19:51,JUNOS VLANs and Trunking,"Today, I'm going to give a quick introduction to VLANs and trunking in JUNOS. VLANs in JUNOS work almost opposite like they do in IOS. You first create a VLAN with a vlan-name and then you assign a vlan-id (dot1q tag). By default all switch-ports are assigned to the 'default' vlan which is untagged (no vlan-id is assigned). 

To create a VLAN:
<pre><code>set vlans &lt;vlan-name&gt; vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre>

You then assign interfaces to a VLAN individually:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
vlan members &lt;vlan-name&gt;</code></pre>

Fairly straight-forward right? Now on to trunking, which differs a good bit from what we are used to with IOS. By default, JUNOS does not specify a native-vlan. Trunks, by default, do not support any (allow) any VLANs. Trunks also do no auto-negotiate by default. 

To set an interface as a trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
port-mode trunk</code></pre>
You can then either explicitly allow individual VLANs, or you can allow all VLANs on the trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
vlan members all</code></pre>

If you would like to trunk to a Cisco device, you must first create a ""native"" vlan (it would help to name it 'native') with a vlan-id of 1 (unless you've changed the native-vlan on the Cisco device). You can then specify the native-vlan on the trunk interface:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
native-vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre> 

I know that this does not appear to be a very easy way of assigning interfaces to VLANs, but at this point in my study it's all that I've got. I am going to do some more research into this, as I'm sure there is a more efficient way of doing things. ",,

8/17/2010 21:37,OSPF Overview Notes,"Summary:
Routers form neighbors and send LSAs (link state announcements). As a router receives LSAs, it uses them to build the LSDB (link state database), applies SPF algorithm to LSDB to select the best routes to populate the routing table.

1. Neighbor discovery
Multicast hellos sent to 224.0.0.5 for neighbor discovery
Must meet requirements:
Same subnet
Hello/dead intervals match
Ip mtu match
Pass authentication
Unique router ids
If routers meet requirements they move to the 2-way state and are then able to move forward with topology exchange. Hellos continue to be sent to monitor responsiveness.

2. Topology exchange
After neighbors form, they exchange LSA headers via DD (database description) messages. The DD messages allow the router to learn what it does not know so that it can request only the complete LSAs it needs. For missing LSAs the router sends a LSR (link state request) which is replied with by a LSU (link state update) and then acknowledged by a LSAck (link state acknowledgement). When all LSAs have been exchanged and both routers have identical LSDBs, they move to the fully adjacent state.

When a DR (designated router) exists, all routers exchange databases only with the DR via a Type 2 LSA psuedo node. DROther (non-dr) nodes send updates to multicast 224.0.0.6 which are processed only by the DR and BDR. Essentially all DROther routers exchange databases only with the DR which then relays back to the rest of the DROthers. This is why only neighborships with the DR will be FULL while neighborships between DROthers remain in a 2-way state.

3. Route selection
Router searches LSDB to find all possible routes to a destination. For each route, the router adds up OSPF interface costs for all outgoing interfaces. The router will then pick the route with the lowest total cost and add the route to the routing table.",,
9/2/2010 20:48,JNCIA-EX / Junos Overview,"I've decided to take a break from my CCNP studies to pursue the JNCIA-EX certification. I've scheduled my exam for the end of September, so I've got some serious studying to do. I decided that an overview of Juniper's Junos CLI would be a good first Juniper blog post.

<strong>CLI</strong>
JUNOS runs on a modified BSD kernel, and because of this when you first log into a device as root you are at the BSD shell. Like Cisco there are different CLI prompt symbols to let you know what level you are at. '%' Specifies the BSD shell. From the BSD shell you can run the command 'cli' to start the Junos CLI in Operational Mode, where you will receive the '&gt;' prompt symbol. From op mode you can type 'configure' to enter Configuration Mode where you will see the '#' prompt symbol. Most of the commands available in operational mode include the 'show' commands, as well as ping, traceroute, telnet, and ssh. To run an operational mode command in config mode you simply preface the command with 'run'. Unlike Cisco's IOS 'do' command, Juniper's JUNOS 'run' command can be used in any config mode context.

<strong>Configs</strong>
The JUNOS config uses a hierarchical design much like XML. Throughout the hierarchy you?ÿ can use 'set', 'delete', or 'rename' to modify config parameters. With JUNOS, unlike IOS, when you enter configuration mode your changes do not take immediate effect. Instead, when you enter configuration mode, you are given a candidate configuration. The candidate configuration is an exact copy of the active configuration, but allows you to make changes without affecting the active configuration. After changes have been made to the candidate config, and you wish to apply the changes to the active config you must save the changes with the 'commit' command. JUNOS also has a rollback configuration which is automatically updated with each commit. JUNOS stores the 50 most recent configs directly on the device, rollback 0 (the active config) and 49 saved rollback configs.

So for a little recap, the device is running the Active configuration. When you enter config mode, you are give a Candidate configuration. After you save the changes with the 'commit' command, the candidate configuration becomes current Active configuration. The previous active configuration becomes Rollback 1, and all the other rollback configs increment down the line. Rollback configs 1-3 are stored on the device in /config/. Rollback configs 4-49 are stored in /var/db/config/.

If you mess up working on the candidate config and want to start again with a fresh candidate config you can use the command 'rollback 0'. If you decide you need to roll back your active config you are able to load any of the 49 stored rollback configs with the command 'rollback <em>n</em>'.

If you want to save a snippet of config you can use the 'save' command. The save command only works at the current config hierarchy, so if you want to save the entire config, you need to make sure you're at the top of the config. This saved config is stored in the user's home directory on the device, unless a remote FTP or SCP server is specified.

If you want to load a snippet you have two options, you can use 'load override' or 'load merge'. 'Load override' will replace the candidate configuration with the loaded config. 'Load merge' will add the loaded config snippet to the candidate configuration without replacing anything. If you want to paste a config snippet through the terminal you can use 'load merge terminal' command and then paste the snippet. If you have a snippet that includes the set commands you will have to use 'load set terminal'.",,
9/11/2010 20:47,JUNOS User Configuration,"Continuing with my Juniper posts, I was going to write a larger post covering a few topics but once I got started writing I realized how large a post this grew to be. So with this post I will only cover some basic user setup to get you started using a Juniper device.

Before you can complete your first commit on a Juniper device you must set a root user password. You can use the following command to set the root users password: <code>set system root-authentication plain-text-password.</code> You will then be prompted to enter and confirm the password. It is important to note that the root user is the only predefined user on JUNOS, and this user also can only log in via the console and SSH, the root user is not allowed to telnet to the device.

After configuring the root user you may want to create individual user accounts. The process to do this is fairly simple, you create the user, assign it to a user class, and then set a local password. The user class defines the privilege and access level. JUNOS includes 3 predefined user classes: <em>operator</em> which allows clear, network, reset, trace, and view commands,<em> read-only</em> which allows for view commands, and <em>super-user</em> which allows all commands. If you need more granular control, you can create custom user classes. To create a new user account you can use the following command: <code>set system login user &lt;username&gt; class &lt;user-class&gt; authentication plaint-text-password.</code> You will then be prompted to enter and confirm the password. (I know I'm skipping RADIUS and TACACS, but I will come back to those later.)

If you happen to forget or need to reset the root password this is a pretty simple process. You need to console to the device and reboot it. Pay attention to look for the prompt to press [Spacebar] for a command prompt. Press the space bar and the boot process will be interrupted and you will be given a <code>loader&gt;</code> prompt. Type <code>boot -s</code> to enter single-user mode. Once it finishes loading type <code>recovery</code> and you will finally arrive at the CLI. From here you can enter config mode, set the root-authentication password again, commit the change, and then reboot the switch with the <code>request system reboot</code> command.",,
9/19/2010 20:41,JUNOS Firewall Filters,"<br>They're called ACLs or Access Control Lists in IOS, but in JUNOS they're called firewall filters. While they appear more complex than a simple ACL line, they do offer much more control and granularity over the commands. JUNOS has 3 different type of firewall filters: port (layer 2) filters, vlan filters, and router (layer 3) filters. Port firewall filters are applied to layer 2 switch ports, only in the ingress direction. VLAN firewall filters can be applied to both ingress and egress directions on a VLAN. Router firewall filters can be applied to the ingress or egress directions on layer 3 interfaces and RVIs (routed vlan interfaces), they can also be applied to the ingress direction on a loopback interface. 

Like IOS, you must configure the firewall filter and then apply it at the correct level. You are only able to apply one firewall filter per port/vlan/router interface, per direction. However the filter is able to support up to 2,048 terms. The firewall filter syntax is as follows:
<pre><code>
firewall {
   family &#91;inet/ethernet-switching&#93; {
      filter &lt;filtername&gt; {
         term &lt;termname&gt; {
            from {
               &lt;match conditions&gt;
            }
            then {
               &lt;action&gt;
            }
         }
      }
   }
}</code></pre>
<br><br>
You can check out <a href=""http://jnpr.net/techpubs/en_US/junos/topics/reference/requirements/firewall-filter-ex-series-match-conditions.html"">this link from Juniper</a> for a nice list of match conditions and actions. As you can see in the link, there are terminating actions and modifying actions.

To match multiple conditions within a term you can use logical AND/OR statements. If the term contains common match statements (such as multiple protocols), it is treated as a logical OR statement. Uncommon match statements are as treated logical AND statements. For example:
<pre><code>
from {
   protocol [tcp udp];
   source-port 123;
}</code></pre>
In this example, the protocol match statement is treated like a logical OR statement, while the combination protocol/source-port  is treated as a logical AND statement.

As a packet is processed through the filter, it is processed by each term in order. If there is a match in a term, and a terminating action is specified, no other terms are processed. If there is an action modifier, but no terminating action, it will default to the action of <i>accept</i>. If there is no match on the filter, the packet is discarded (implicit discard). 

That should be a quick overview of firewall filters in JUNOS. I will pick up next time with applying firewall filters.",,
10/5/2010 14:51,JUNOS is Out of This World!!,"<pre><code>show route martians</code></pre>
Say what? Martians? Aliens? Ok ok, I know it's corny but I learned something new today and it made me grin.

So it turns out Martian addresses are not how you get a letter to Mars, instead they are network addresses for which JUNOS decides to ignore all routing information. These addresses are never added to the routing table, and usually are only present by misconfiguration/mistake.

The IPv4 addresses which are by default considered Martian addresses are:
<ul>
	<li>0.0.0.0/8</li>
	<li>127.0.0.0/8</li>
	<li>128.0.0.0/16</li>
	<li>191.255.0.0/16</li>
	<li>192.0.0.0/24</li>
	<li>223.255.255.0/24</li>
	<li>240.0.0.0/4</li>
</ul>
In IPv6:
<ul>
	<li>Loopback address (::1)</li>
	<li>Reserved and unassigned prefixes from <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt"" target=""_blank"">RFC 2373</a> (which apparently has been obsoleted by <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4291.txt"" target=""_blank"">RFC 4291</a>)</li>
	<li>Link-local unicast prefix (fe80::/100)</li>
</ul>
You can also add additional prefixes to the list of Martian addresses by setting prefix lists in the <code>[edit routing-options martians]</code> hierarchy. You are able to specify the prefix, bit mask, and a match type. The match types you can choose from are:
<ul>
	<li>exact</li>
	<li>longer</li>
	<li>orlonger</li>
	<li>prefix-length-range</li>
	<li>through</li>
	<li>upto</li>
</ul>
You can also specify the <code>allow</code> command to remove a prefix from the Martian address list.

Some examples:
<pre><code>
[edit routing-options]
root@Router# set martians 31/8 orlonger
root@Router# set martians 240/4 orlonger allow
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
root@Router&gt; show route martians
root@Router&gt; show route martians table inet.0
</code></pre>

9/29/2010 19:07,Hands on Hardware - Juniper,"
So we've recently decided to consolidate our two existing data centers into a single data center and move them to an off-site co-location. Part of this new project involved redesigning our data center network. Let me tell you, know is an exciting time to be building a new data center. We looked at Cisco, Juniper, and Brocade to get their proposals for our new data center. Brocade at the time did not have a 10GE top-of-rack switch. Cisco, with their Nexus line looked like a solid option, though the missing L3 functionality in the 5020 pushed us away. In the end, Juniper had a solid offering at a competitive price. There was some hesitation moving away from an all Cisco network, though in the end we are pleased with our decision.

Our design consists of SRX650s for our edge, EX4500s in the top-of-rack, and also EX4500s for our core. We debated what to put in the core, but with our small footprint (we're looking at two racks once we are more virtualized) we decided that the EX4500s would suffice. There will also be some 4200s and 2200s for some other peripheral uses.

Well we cut POs, and the blue boxes have started to show up. I thought I'd share some pictures I took while I was inventorying and assembling the devices and modules.

9/30/2010 19:36,JNCIA-EX Success!!,"
Thought I'd share a little good news... I took my JNCIA-EX exam today, and I passed! The Juniper exam seems to be a little more JUNOS orientated instead of the networking fundamentals that the CCNA containted. There were no subnetting questions, and the exam almost assumes a prior knowledge of the networking basics (though the O'Reilly JUNOS Ent. Switching book does cover the basics). 

Overall I'd say it was a good exam and I look forward to starting my study for the JNCIS-ENT.",,
9/29/2011 12:59,Security Policy and Address Groups,"I recently sat through a Juniper Security (JSEC) training course and learned something new about security policy regarding the objects that are able to be referenced in policy. When I got back to work I had a few rules I needed to add and some that needed to be removed so I thought it would be a good point to make the switch. I am talking about the use of address groups in security policy.?ÿBefore?ÿwe can reference a prefix in security policy it must be created as an address object. These address objects are stored in an address-book <em>per</em> security zone.?ÿ We can also create address-sets (Junos) and address groups (ScreenOS) which are basically groups consisting of individual address members. When we create a security policy, instead of creating a policy for each address entry, we can reference the address-set/address group to apply the policy to like entries. This allows us to change individual entries for a policy without directly affecting the policy.?ÿFor example, I have a group of 5 servers that need web access to download updates, but I don't want the entire zone to have Internet access. Instead of creating 5 individual policies I can create a single policy and refence an address-set/address group which consists of the 5 server address objects. In the future if I ever decide to give a new server Internet access or I need to remove Internet access for a server, I don't have to worry about cluttered policies, I can just add or remove an address to the address-set/address group.
<h2>Junos</h2>
We first need to create our address objects:
<pre>set security zones security-zone *ZoneName* address-book *AddressName* x.x.x.x/y</pre>
Then we need to create our address-set:
<pre>set security zones security-zone *ZoneName* address-book address-set *SetName* address *AddressName*</pre>
A few caveats, an address-set can only exist when there multiple addresses in the address-book. An address-set can only contain addresses from the same security zone, and also the address-set name cannot be the same as an existing address name.
<h2>ScreenOS</h2>
First create the address objects:
<pre>set address *ZoneName* *AddressName* x.x.x.x/y *Comment*</pre>
Then create the address group:
<pre>set group address *ZoneName* *GroupName* *Comment*
set group address *ZoneName* *GroupName* add *AddressName*</pre>
One thing I noticed?ÿin the Junos TechPubs was that?ÿwhen you reference an address-set in?ÿpolicy?ÿJunos creates an internal rule for each member, as well as each service. So if you create a policy which references an address-set for both source and destination and also a service group, Junos actually creates multiple internal rules. If you don't pay attention to the size of your groups you could exceed policy resources even though it appears you have a relatively small number of configured policies.

The?ÿmain point I want to?ÿconvey isn't necessarily how to configure address sets/groups, but to motivate you to use them. It's standard practice in the Windows AD realm where you rarely want to give an individual user rights to a server, it's much cleaner to give a security group rights to the server and then manage the membership of that group. This is particularly helpful if the same group will be referenced on multiple servers. The same concept applies to our firewall security policies.

So go forth and simplify your firewall rules...",,
7/25/2011 18:54,"Link Aggregation Showdown - Juniper, Cisco, VMware","A friend and I got into a discussion regarding supported link aggregation methods between VMware and various networking vendors. As I was trying to inform him of the differences, I was sure to do my research and I thought I would share.

He was using Cisco switches and wanted to run LACP because he thought that Cisco's Etherchannel did not have any negotiation protocol unless you used LACP. He then thought that VMware would support LACP, since it was an open standard after-all. We have both been bitten by misconfigured link aggregations when connecting to VMware. It turns out he was wrong here on both fronts. First of all, VMware only supports static configuration for link aggregation (NIC teaming as they call it.) Secondly, Cisco's Etherchannel does support negotiation using PAgP(Cisco Proprietary), if configured to do so. I just wanted to point this out for future reference. So I put together a quick cheat sheet for him to use building link aggregation bundles across vendors.

Static Link Aggregation:
VMware - Configure the port group NIC teaming to ""Route Based on IP Hash""
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode on</pre>
Juniper - <pre>set interface &lt;name&gt; ether-options 802.3ad ae#</pre>

Link Aggregation Negotiation (LACP):
VMware - Not Supported
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode active</pre>
Juniper - The Static Configuration + <pre>set interface ae# aggregated-ether-options lacp active</pre>

Link Aggregation Negotiation (PAgP):
VMware - Not Supported
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode desirable</pre>
Juniper - Not Supported

There are also passive configuration options for both LACP  and PAgP, however I prefer to always statically define my port roles. These are also not complete configs for either Cisco or Juniper, I merely wanted to point out the differences in the commands between the different vendors.",,

<ul>
	<li>I predict we will see networking products become more tightly integrated with virtualization products such as VMware. Some companies are already starting to deliver products which integrate with vCenter, but I expect to see many more.</li>
	<li>TRILL/SPB will gain traction and we might possibly see it start to be implemented towards the end of the 2011.</li>
	<li>I'm going to step out there and say that FCoE won't gain much traction in 2011. I think protocols such as iSCSI or NFS will continue to improve, and we may see the development of a new protocol.</li>
	<li>Frame relay will continue to die a slow death at the hands of MPLS.</li>
</ul>
Any my personal resolutions for 2011:
<ul>
	<li>Get that CCNP and JNCIS. I'd like to have these completed by summer time so I can begin reading for my CCIE studies.</li>
	<li>Really understand MPLS.</li>

10/17/2011 20:44,SRX Firewall User Authentication,"Juniper SRX firewalls have a feature called Firewall User Authentication. FUA is another layer of protection on top of security policies to restrict/permit users or groups of users individually. FUA is a very limited feature but it could be used as a poor-man's NAC in a pinch. Users are authenticated via a single external source(RADIUS, LDAP, or SecureID) or the local database. FUA can operate in two different modes, Pass-Through Authentication, and Web Authentication.

Pass-Through Authentication is limited to Telnet, FTP, and HTTP traffic only(notice these are plain-text protocols). Pass-through auth works by interjecting a login challenge into the original protocol login challenge. For example a user would initiate a telnet connection, the FUA would interject and prompt the security challenge. Once authenticated, traffic from the same source IP is automatically allowed to pass through the SRX(could be dangerous with source NAT). This would allow the telnet connection to continue and the user can authenticate to the telnet host. Once the user has authenticated via FUA the IP address becomes exempt from further FUA requirements. This means that you can create a security policy that matches on ANY traffic type and require FUA; Pass-through authentication only works with Telnet, FTP, or HTTP, however once the IP/user has authenticated then it is exempt from further FUA, and it is then only bound by security policy. I said that to say this: you can use a telnet session to authenticate a user via FUA who, once authenticated, can pass any type of traffic which is allowed by the security policy.

Web Authentication operates in two sub-modes, standard web authentication, and web redirect. Standard web auth first requires you enable the HTTP system service, and also allow http in host-inbound-traffic. With standard web auth, you would direct your users to a secondary IP address of an interface on the SRX. Users would be prompted with an HTTP login form for the FUA. Once authenticated the IP address is added to the exempt list and is able to pass through the firewall as much as security policy allows. The web redirect operates like standard web auth, but you don't have to hand out an IP address of your firewall or direct users to a separate login page. Web redirect works much like what you're used to in a hotel room; You open your browser and head to Google.com, and you are automagically redirected to a login page. Once you authenticate you are able to pass through the firewall as much as security policy allows.

With all the authentication methods you are also able to configure a default timeout for inactivity and login/success/failure banners. Web redirect + a login banner would be a great poor-man option for a Guest Wireless NAC. You could hand out the username and password to guests, and they would be prompted with the Acceptable Use Policy before logging in.

<span style=""color:#ff0000;"">All FUA configuration follows the same basic principles: configure an access profile, configure the firewall authentication options, and finally call on the firewall authentication from security policy. (Good to know on an exam).</span>

Configure the access profile (local user database):

<pre>set access profile *profile-name* client *name* firewall-user password *pwd*</pre>

or (external authentication):

<pre>set access profile *profile-name* authentication-order [radius password]
set access profile *profile-name* radius-server *ip-address* secret *radius-secret*</pre>

Then configure the authentication type and options:

<pre>set access firewall-authentication pass-through default-profile *profile-name*
set access firewall-authentication pass-through [telnet/ftp/http] banner login ""You must login""</pre>

or

<pre>set interface *name* unit 0 family inet address *ip/mask* web-authentication http
set access firewall-authentication web-authentication default-profile *profile-name*
set access firewall-authentication web-authentication banner success ""Login successful""</pre>

Finally set a permit action of firewall-authentication in the security policy. For pass-through use: ""Permit firewall-authentication pass-through client-match *client-name*"". For web auth use: ""Permit firewall-authentication web-authentication client-match *client-name*"". For web redirect use the same as pass-through but add a web-redirect argument: ""Permit firewall-authentication pass-through web-redirect"".

And finally to verify:

<pre>show security firewall-authentication users
show security firewall-authentication history</pre>",,

11/22/2011 8:23,Working with IPv6 and Juniper SRX,"I finally decided that if I don??t run IPv6 then I am never truly going to understand it. I figured the best place to get started would be my own home. I didn??t want to completely get rid of my IPv4 network, I only wanted to try to get IPv6 up and running, so I decided to run a dual-stack. Since the computers are running Windows 7 and I have an SRX100 as our household firewall this proved not to be a problem. Also, it was only an after-thought, but apparently our wireless access point would pass the IPv6 traffic without any problems. My next problem was external IPv6 connectivity, what good would my private IPv6 network be if I couldn??t connect to any other IPv6 networks?

Enter Hurricane Electric and their free IPv6 tunnel broker service at <a href=""http://tunnelbroker.net/"" target=""_blank"">http://tunnelbroker.net/</a>. This is a free service that allows you to build a 6to4 tunnel to their network which then acts as your IPv6 gateway. 6to4 tunneling (RFC 3056 <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056"" target=""_blank"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056</a>) is an IPv6 transition mechanism which allows IPv6 packets to be encapsulated (aka tunneled) within IPv4 packets to a 6to4 gateway router which is then de-encapsulated and sent on to IPv6 networks. So I registered with HE using my external IPv4 address as the tunnel end-point and was assigned my tunnel endpoints as well as my very own routed /64 block of IPv6 addresses. I was also given an IPv6 DNS server to point to. It was finally time to get IPv6 up and running.

The first thing I needed to do was get my tunnel up and running. On my SRX100 this involved creating an IP tunnel interface, adding an IPv6 static route, and putting the SRX in packet-mode for IPv6 traffic.
<pre>
interfaces {
   ip-0/0/0 {
      unit 0 {
         tunnel {
            source 99.111.88.228;
            destination 216.66.22.2;
         }
         family inet6 {
            address 2001:470:7:e9e::2/64;
         }
      }
   }
}
routing-options {
   rib inet6.0 {
      static {
         route ::/0 next-hop 2001:470:7:e9e::1;
      }
   }
}
security {
   forwarding-options {
      family {
         inet6 {
            mode packet-based;
         }
      }
   }
}
</pre>
At that point I could see my tunnel was operational and I was able to ping the remote end of the tunnel. Next I needed to get IPv6 running internally. I decided to use Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) for address configuration. Devices running IPv6 will automatically configure for themselves a link-local address. This address is created using the FE80::/64 block + the EIU64 Interface ID. The EIU64 Interface ID is dynamically created using the Ethernet MAC address. The link-local address is required for basic IPv6 operations such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) which is used for SLAAC. Basically the link-local address allows for local communication of hosts without configuration in order to facilitate higher-level communications. One thing about link-local address are that they are not globally routable, which means that my computers with only a link-local IPv6 address would not be able to communicate with other IPv6 devices such as web servers.

I needed to use my /64 block of globally routable IPv6 addresses I was given and assign them to my hosts. To do this I needed to configure IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to allow my hosts to use SLAAC and auto-configure themselves an IPv6 address.
<pre>
interfaces {
   vlan {
      unit 0 {
         family inet {
            address 192.168.1.1/24;
         }
         family inet6 {
            address 2001:470:8:e9e::1/64;
         }
      }
   }
}
protocols {
   router-advertisement {
      interface vlan.0 {
         max-advertisement-interval 20;
         min-advertisement-interval 15;
         prefix 2001:470:8:e9e::/64;
      }
   }
}
</pre>
Now my hosts have both a link-local and a global IPv6 address and are able to ping through my tunnel. So far I haven??t done enough experimenting to get DHCPv6 working for DNS server assignment so I currently have my hosts DNS servers statically configured. I was then able to go online and check my IPv6 connectivity via <a href=""http://test-ipv6.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://test-ipv6.com/</a>.

Caveats:
Packet-based forwarding of IPv6 - Still researching the implications of this in regards to security
Had to use Junos 10.4R7.5 to assign family inet6 on vlan interfaces
Still have to experiment with DNS server assignment either through DHCPv6 or some other means
Lack of IPv6 websites/stuff to do

I now want to expound on that idea by pinging a list of hosts saved in a text file. To do this we simply open the text file as an array of lines and then use a ""for...each"" loop to ping each host individually. Each line contains a hidden newline character which has to be removed in order for the Net::Ping method to process the variable correctly. I attempted to use the Perl Chomp() function, however this was yielding strange results. After some experimentation I found an answer using my first foray into regular expressions (regex). Using the Perl search and replace regex function I was able to search the individual line for the newline character and replace it with nothing. I used a handy little tool, which you can find <a href=""http://www.regextester.com/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, to practice and see if my regex matched correctly on the newline character. 

Here is the script I ended up with:
<pre>
use Net::Ping;
use strict;
open(MYINPUTFILE, ""hosts.txt"");
my(@hosts) = &lt;MYINPUTFILE&gt;;
my($host);
foreach $host (@hosts) {
	$host =~ s/s+$//; #strip newline character from variable
	my $pingobj = Net::Ping-&gt;new('icmp');
	my ($status,$time,$ip) = $pingobj-&gt;ping($host);
	if ($status) {
		print ""Host $host ($ip) responded in $time secondsn"";
	} else {
		print ""Host $host ($ip) unreachablen"";
	}
}
close(MYINPUTFILE);
</pre>

And the results:

I created a hosts.txt file and put it alongside the script and for testing purposes I tried a few different formats for host entries as well as a ""null"" value to make sure the script was working as designed. I hope you can pick up where I am headed with this building block. This script will be the basis for more advanced scripts such as automating changes to multiple devices. ",,

4/19/2011 20:04,Quick Update,"I wanted to give a quick update on my current job situation. Since it is what I do all day, it produces most of the ideas and content that I fill my blog with. My current position has me wearing multiple hats. While my title is Network Engineer, I'm also standing up a VMware environment, administering a few NetApp SANs, and ensuring the infrastructure servers (DCs, AV, etc.) are in place. With these additional responsibilities I've started to have more ideas for blog topics related to virtualization. 

I just wanted to give everyone a heads up so you weren't left wondering when virtualization posts start appearing on what had been a solely network-related blog. I might also start writing about general office life in the IT career field as well, depends on how the stats react.  I will keep networking my primary focus, as it is my primary interest, but we'll have to see where this converged position takes me (and this blog).",,
11/2/2010 12:07,Twinax/DAC Cable Differences,"I am currently in the process of implementing Juniper EX4500 switches to deliver 10GE connectivity to our ESX host servers. During this process we decided to go the route of direct attach copper (DAC) cables to save money. We dug around what little research we could find and eventually decided to purchase Brocade converged network adapters (CNAs) to install in our servers. When we finally got around to mocking up this setup in our lab this week we ran into a major issue. I was unable to get the physical link between the server and the switch to come up. We swapped out the cable to try this Brocade DAC cable we just happened to have laying around and the link came right up. That was interesting, so we started doing a little research...

Are all DAC cables created equally? The answer is no. There are two types of DAC cables: Active and Passive. Scientific Computer has a <a href=""http://www.scientificcomputing.com/High-speed-Copper-Interconnects-Address-Critical-HPCHurdles.aspx"" target=""_blank"">good article</a> listing the differences between active and passive cables.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-286"" title=""DAC Cables"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg?w=300"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>You can see here three different cables. The one on the left is the Brocade active cable. The middle is the Juniper passive cable, and the one on the right is a Cisco passive cable. You can see the contact pad difference between the active and passive cables.

What does this mean to us network engineers? Vendor support. Not every vendor supports both passive and active cables, while some vendors require active cables. Take our situation for example: Juniper does not currently support active DAC cables, however the Brocade CNAs we purchased will only work with an active cable. This put us in a tight spot. Take this opportunity to learn from our mistake, check with your vendors regarding passive/active cable support if you are planning on implementing 10GE direct-attach copper cables.",,

11/9/2010 13:58,IOS - VLAN Access Lists,"So we all know how to filter traffic as it passes between VLANs or between L3 interfaces using standard ACLs. But what do we do about filtering traffic withing a VLAN? Say we want to isolate a single host by disallowing it to communicate with other hosts in the same subnet? Step in the VACL. The switch TCAM performs the VACL matching and action as packets are switched within the VLAN or routed to a different VLAN. There is no need to specify inbound or outbound direction. VACLs are configured as VLAN access maps much like a route map. 

You first have to configure the VACL:
<pre>Switch(config)# vlan access-map &lt;map-name&gt; [sequence-number]</pre>
The access-maps are processed in sequence-number order. You are able to have multiple matching conditions followed by an action.
<pre>Switch(config-access-map)# match ip address {acl-number | acl-name}
Switch(config-access-map)# match mac address &lt;acl-name&gt;
Switch(config-access-map)# action {drop | forward | capture} | redirect &lt;port&gt;}</pre>

The next step is to apply the VACL to the VLAN:
<pre>Switch(config)# vlan filter &lt;map-name&gt; vlan-list &lt;vlan-list&gt;</pre>
You are able to apply the VACL to multiple VLANs using the vlan-list.

This has been a quick and dirty look at VACLs, another tool for your toolbox.",,
12/21/2010 11:00,JUNOS - Security Policies,"As I have been continuing to setup our Juniper SRX firewalls I thought I would take a moment to discuss how to implement security policies in JUNOS. Before we get started I think it's important to cover a few quick concepts:
<ul>
	<li>Stateful Firewall - Monitors the state of network connection streams so that when traffic is inspected and permitted in one direction, the return traffic is also permitted.</li>
	<li>Zone-Based Firewall - Interfaces are arranged into groups called zones to build security boundaries</li>
	<li>JUNOS Security Policy Applications - Applications are a sort of profiles for apps which have defined protocol standards. Applications store information such as transport protocol, source and destination port numbers, and timeout values. These applications can be grouped into an Application-Set in order to simplify policy creation for multi-port applications. JUNOS has many predefined applications and also has the capability to define custom applications as needed. For more information, check out <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-security/junos-security10.0/junos-security-swconfig-security/policy-apps-understanding.html#policy-apps-understanding"" target=""_blank"">Juniper's documentation</a>.</li>
	<li>JUNOS Security Addresses - When building security policies, JUNOS relies on predefined addresses or address books which contain entries for either IP prefixes or FQDNs. Multiple addresses can be grouped together into an address-set to simplify policy creation for a group of address or prefixes.</li>
</ul>
JUNOS security policies are different from <a title=""JUNOS Firewall?ÿFilters"" href=""http://robertjuric.com/2010/09/19/junos-firewall-filters/"" target=""_blank"">firewall filters</a> in that security policies are stateful and applied to security zones, while firewall filters are stateless and applied directly to interfaces. Now let's get to it. The first thing we have to do is setup our security zones. A security zone is configured with 3 main components, the address-book, the interfaces, and host-inbound-traffic rules. The first two are pretty self-explanatory; host-inbound-traffic rules are configured to secure traffic originating from connected hosts within a zone. In other words, host-inbound-traffic rules are used to protect a zone from internal attacks. See <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-es/junos-es92/junos-es-swconfig-security/configuring-host-inbound-traffic.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for more information on configuring host-inbound-traffic.

Here is an example config for a trust and untrust zone:
<pre>set security zones security-zone trust address-book address mail01 dns-name mail01srv.domain.com
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address mail02 dns-name mail02srv.domain.com
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address-set mail_servers address mail01
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address-set mail_servers address mail02
set security zones security-zone trust host-inbound-traffic system-services all
set security zones security-zone trust host-inbound-traffic protocols all
set security zones security-zone trust interfaces ge-0/0/0
set security zones security-zone trust interfaces lo0.0

set security zones security-zone untrust host-inbound-traffic system-services ping
set security zones security-zone untrust host-inbound-traffic system-services traceroute
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/1
</pre>
Now that we have our two zones configured, they are by default policy not permitted to pass any traffic. So we must configure policies to allow traffic to flow between the zones. Security policies work much like firewall filters in that they use a series of ""match...then"" statements which are applied to traffic in the order they are listed. A policy 'match' statement must specify a source-address, a destination-address, and an application. These specifications can be address-sets and application-sets respectively. A policy 'then' statement can contain either:
<ul>
	<li> Permit - Allows traffic to pass</li>
	<li> Deny - Denies traffic to pass by *silently* dropping the packet</li>
	<li> Reject - Denies traffic to pass by dropping the packet, but also sends an ICMP Port Unreachable reply for every dropped packet</li>
	<li> Log - An option to enable logging of the sessions, requires the creation of a logfile via ""set system syslog file &lt;file-name&gt; &lt;options&gt; ""</li>
	<li> Count - An option to enable counting (in bytes or kilobytes) of all traffic permitted by the policy</li>
</ul>
Here is an example of a few policies which will first allow SMTP traffic from my mail servers, then block SMTP from any host, and finally all any traffic:
<pre>set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match source-address mail_servers
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match application junos-smtp
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp then permit

set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match application junos-smtp
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp then deny
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp then log session-init session-close

set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match application any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow then permit
</pre>
It is important to take note of the policy ordering. Security policies are applied in order. If my internet-allow policy were at the top of the list, it would make my SMTP filtering policies useless. I could fix this easily this with the command:
<pre>insert policy &lt;name&gt;  {before/after} policy &lt;name&gt;</pre>
That gives you the basic run-down to configure security policies in JUNOS. I would recommend reading the documentation when it comes planning time so that you can properly configure the correct features for your requirements.",,

1/24/2011 20:22,Introduction to ScreenOS,"I feel like I haven't written in a while but I've been going through a job transition. I finally feel like I'm starting to settle in and I thought I would share some of my new experiences learning about the Juniper Netscreen firewalls.

Unlike a majority of Juniper firewall users, I've had no experience with Netscreen firewalls. I was a little a little off-balance trying to pick up the SCREENOS commands, but once I got going on it I found they made logical sense and were similar to the JUNOS commands (sometimes).

My new job involves standing up a new development ""enclave"" network. When I arrived, a few others had turns unsuccessfully trying to make the network go, so my first task was to get the firewall passing traffic. I spent a few hours that night researching the basics of SCREENOS and the next day I was able to get the packets flowing.

SCREENOS CLI is very similar to to JUNOS in that it uses 'set' commands to make configuration changes. SCREENOS also differs greatly in that it uses 'get' commands to view config snippets.

<pre>get config
get interface
get policy</pre>
A few examples of the 'get' commands

I learned to imagine SCREENOS in layers. The foundation layer is the virtual-router, which closely resembles routing-instances in JUNOS. There are two system configured VRs: trust-vr and untrust-vr. The virtual routers are essentially routing table instances. The next layer is compromised of the security zones, which are by default assigned to the trust-vr virtual router. From here we need to step back and see how the Netscreen operates. It can operate in one of three modes, NAT mode, route mode, and transparent mode. I like to think of the 3rd layer of the Netscreen as the interfaces. When an interface is assigned to the Trust security zone it is by default configured in NAT mode, if you wish to configure straight routing you must explicitly configure it. Also, before you can assign an IP address to an interface, the interface must first be assigned to a security zone.?ÿ 

<pre>set int eth2/1 zone Trust
set int eth2/1 ip 10.10.1.1/30
set int eth2/1 route
set int eth1/1 zone Untrust
set int eth1/1 ip 10.10.2.1/30
</pre>

Now that we have our virtual router, security zones, and interfaces configured, the next layer consists of the routing and security policies which will allow the traffic to flow. The first thing we can do is configure a static default route:

<pre>set route 0.0.0.0/0 interface eth1/1 gateway 10.10.2.2</pre>

The next thing we need to do is configure a security policy to allow some traffic to flow through our security zones:

<pre>set policy from Trust to Untrust any any any permit</pre>
This policy consists of a source zone, destination zone, source object, destination object, and control action. More simply it reads: From zone Trust to zone Untrust and from any address to any address using any protocol then allow. Like JUNOS, SCREENOS uses address objects any time it references a specific IP or range of IPs in a security policy. For instance:
<pre>set address DMZ 192.168.75.1/32 ""Exchange""
set address Untrust 1.1.1.16/28 ""SmartHost""
set policy from Untrust to DMZ SmartHost Exchange smtp permit</pre>

That's pretty much the basics of getting the firewall to pass traffic. A quick note with the policies. If you do a 'get policy' it will list a policy id number next to each entry. You can then do 'unset policy id #' to remove policies. I just wanted to take a second to share with you my introduction to SCREENOS. I plan to write some more about it and the Netscreen firewalls as I spend more time working with them.",,
1/25/2011 11:49,10GE Killed the Hub,"I was talking to a fellow network engineer the other day showing off our new 10GE equipment and he made a comment how 10GE was a totally different technology than standard Ethernet because it did not use CSMA/CD. I acknowledged I didn't know what he was talking about and ran off to do some research, at which point I feel I fell into the Ethernet rabbit hole. I thought I would share my finding with you.

Let's get down and dirty with a quick overview of the base layers of the OSI model:

Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is compromised of both physical and data-link layer protocols that define the technology we network engineers all know and love. 

The data link layer consists of two sub-layers. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer. The MAC is a communication protocol sub-layer that provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms. In other words the MAC layer is pretty much our beloved 48-bit MAC addresses and CSMA/CD. MAC operates between the LLC sublayer and the physical layer to emulate full duplex communication. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing so that muliple network protocols can coexist on the same media (such as IP &amp; IPX), and also provides flow control mechanisms. The LLC sub-layer acts as an interface between the MAC sublayer and the network layer.

Duplex is a method that two units communicate with each other in both directions. Half-duplex provides communication in both directions but only one direction at a time. Full duplex allows bi-directional communication simultaneously. Half-duplex can lead to collisions and re-transmissions (hence the need for CSMA/CD.) Full duplex allows communication simultaneously in both directions so there are no collisions. In full-duplex communication, a MAC layer is not necessary though it is still implemented for hardware addressing purposes. A hub is a good example of half-duplex communication.

Carrier Sense Multiple Acces (CSMA) is a MAC protocol in which a node verifies the absense of traffic before transmitting on a shared medium. CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a modification of CSMA that improves performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected. 

Flow Control is implemented in Ethernet with 802.1x when one station is sending traffic faster than the other 
station can receive it. When this happens a station sends a PAUSE command to a bridge group address and all data is stopped. On a side note: This messes with Classes of Service (802.1p) because all priorities are stopped. One of the new Data Center Bridging protocols, Priority Flow Control (802.1Qbb), attempts to address this issue by indicating pause time for each priority separately.

Now back to the original comment:
1000BASE-T supports autonegotiation of half-duplex communication when necessary. 10GE defines only full duplex links, so half-duplex and therefore CSMA/CD do not exist. The statement by my fellow engineer is correct, 10GE is missing CSMA/CD. However since Gigabit Ethernet, when operating in full duplex, doesn't utilize CSMA/CD either, I now consider it a bold statement that 10GE is totally different from standard Gig Ethernet. It could be said however that 10GE killed the hub!",,
3/25/2011 20:20,JUNOS - Destination NAT as Port Forwarding,"I recently moved into a new house and a new cable Internet provider. I decided I'd take the opportunity to upgrade my home network and implement a Juniper SRX100 (I &lt;3 JUNOS) as my Internet router/firewall.
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0963.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-420"" title=""HomeNetwork"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0963.jpg?w=300"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The initial setup of the SRX100 was surprisingly pain-free. I had to reset it to factory defaults after I had been using it for some labbing, and the factory default config worked pretty much out of the box. I run a few private servers at my house and needed to setup some port forwarding as I only have a single public IP address. You can easily accomplish this with JUNOS Destination NAT, and I would like to share with you some interesting quirks I found in its implementation.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Destination NAT works by specifying NAT rules based upon a packet's destination address (and port). By configuring NAT rules based on the destination address of your public IP address you're able to to redirect a certain address or port to a private internal address of your choosing. In the case of the standard home user you would specify rules for different ports destined (incoming) to your single public IP address to be translated to multiple private addresses (one-to-many NAT). If you had multiple public IP addresses you could configure the different address to be redirected to multiple private addresses (many-to-many NAT).</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Configuration of Destination NAT is also relatively simple; it only requires a destination pool for your internal server(s), NAT rules, and a security policy to allow traffic to flow between the zones.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">I first configured a single pool for my internal server's IP address:</p>

<pre>set security nat destination pool &lt;pool_name&gt; address 192.168.1.5/32</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Next I began to configure NAT rules for each port I wanted to forward. This is also where it got interesting. The syntax for creating NAT rules is:</p>

<pre>set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; from zone untrust
set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; rule &lt;rule_name&gt; match destination-address 0.0.0.0/0

set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; rule &lt;rule_name&gt; then destination-nat pool &lt;pool_name&gt;
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">To keep things straightforward I named my rule-set ""untrust-to-trust"" and the rule names to match the port number (i.e. Port1024). Setting the destination-address to 0/0 is not in the documentation, but it will work if you rely on a dynamically assigned public IP address like I do. Another issue I ran into was a limitation on the number of rules allowed in a rule-set. Any JUNOS code version before 10.1R1 has a limitation of 8 rules per rule-set.?ÿ You can see how this could become a problem if you're attempting to forward a range of IP addresses. A code upgrade resolved this problem for me and extended the limitation to 512 rules per rule-set. Unfortunately there is no way to configure destination NAT for a range of ports, each rule is limited to a single port definition.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The final step requires configuring a security policy and address book entry to allow traffic to cross zones:</p>

<pre>set security zones security-zone trust address-book address &lt;address_name&gt; 192.168.1.5/32
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match source-address any
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match destination-address &lt;address_name&gt;
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match application any
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; then permit
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">You can obviously keep your security tighter by specifying an application instead of using 'application any'.?ÿ The NAT is applied before the security policies are checked which is why the NAT rule's destination address is your public IP address and the security policy's destination address is the private internal IP address.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">By using Destination NAT in JUNOS?ÿ you can effectively implement port forwarding for your home network. I'm satisfied with my SRX as a home router/firewall and enjoy the flexibility it brings.</p>",,
2/24/2011 5:42,What is QFabric?,"Yesterday Juniper released another piece to the Project Stratus puzzle. Project Stratus is Juniper's attempt at a 3-2-1 process of flattening the data center hierarchy model. They introduced the new <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/qfx-series/qfx3500/"">QFX3500 switch</a>, and the concept of <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/whitepapers/2000384-en.pdf"">QFabric</a>. As always, Twitter went crazy. I did enjoy the back and forth, it was educational listening to different perspectives from people much smarter than myself. A small debate broke out whether or not Juniper's QFabric was different from Cisco's FabricPath. I'm writing this article to hopefully entice some other opinions or blog replies. I'm sure not an expert, but I'm going to do my best to explain what I think the differences are. I'm not going to say one is better than the other, but to myself they do appear different.

<strong>Hardware</strong>

The QFX3500 is a 1U 48port 10GE switch, fully L2/L3 capable. This box seems similar to the Cisco Nexus 5548 switch. Not much to get excited about here, it was about time Juniper released something comparable.

Is there a major difference? I'm thinking no.

<strong>The Design, Stratus, QFabric</strong>

Project Stratus is supposed to consist of the QFX3500s linked back to a large chassis switch, which has yet to be released, using Juniper's new QSFP+ ports. This is supposed to yield an extension of the control plane(packets are processed once at ingress to the ""fabric""), and a single point of management. This concept sounds to me like how the Nexus 7000 can now support Nexus 2000s hanging off of it. I see two differences here: <del>1. Cisco does it with standard SFP+ ports</del>(I made the mistake of not researching the standard QSFP+ ports Juniper uses), and 2. The Nexus 2000 is little more than a dumb line-card and does not do any packet processing. I'm not sure if the method how the Stratus/QFX3500 or the Nexus 7k/2k uplink is much different(i.e. fex-fabric ports vs. Juniper's yet to be released config info), I plan on doing some more research into that.

Is there a major difference? I think a few small details, but the design is quite similar.

<strong>FabricPath = QFabric?</strong>

According to Cisco, FabricPath ""brings the stability and scalability of routing to Layer 2."" FabricPath is more of a L2 domain control innovation, or a stop-gap to TRILL/SPB, than a control plane extension. However, if you look at the FEX Fabric that links Nexus 5k&gt;2k or 7k&gt;2k, now that is a more accurate comparison to QFabric. With FEX Fabric and QFabric, the packet is processed once, and forwarded directly to it's destination. FabricPath still relies on multiple switch hops to operate. I think Juniper looks at from the view that if the network operates like one giant switch fabric, then there are no multiple hops and therefore no need for TRILL/SPB.

Is FabricPath = QFabric? I don't think so. But it does sound similar to Cisco's FEX Fabric.

<strong>Vaporware?</strong>

Yes. Juniper has only released the QFX3500 switch, which today can be used as a standard 10GE ToR switch. For Project Stratus to come together they still have to release their director chassis switch which will then use QFabric to interconnect the QFX3500s.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

First I'm a little disappointed in Juniper for being so vague. If I hadn't already talked to our Juniper reps about this release, I think I would be even more confused. Is QFabric similar to FabricPath? I still don't think so, but I'm open to being educated. Is QFabric revolutionary? At first I thought it was, but after seeing the Twitter-discussion, I'm not so sure now. Please feel free to reply/inform/complain, I'm on Twitter <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/robertjuric"">@robertjuric</a>.",,
6/21/2013 12:23,Bits on a Wire,"Bits, Frames, Packets, Streams, Datagrams; we have many terms for what basically involves getting information sent across a transmission medium. However, I like details, and I think that the terms should be used correctly. As somebody once told me, ""Words have meanings!"" So let's get a few things straight:

<strong>Bits</strong> - The last logical unit of data before the information is turned into an electrical or optical signal.

<strong>Frames</strong> - Layer 2 data units used to transfer data between adjacent network nodes. Provides frame synchronization (framing) and can provide error detection.

<strong>Packets</strong> - Used to establish the path which data travels from host-to-host. In the world of networking and the OSI model, this strictly refers to Layer 3 (IPv4 or IPv6).

Let's pause right here to make a special note between frames and packets and their uses. Frames are used at L2 to transfer data between adjacent nodes, while packets are used at L3 to transfer data between end-to-end hosts. What this means is that L2 frame headers(src/dst addresses) are rewritten at each node while L3 packet headers (src/dst addresses) do not change.

<strong>Segments/Streams/Datagrams</strong> - Used by Layer 4 protocols to provide end to end communication for applications. Datagram is a term used when delivery, time, or order are not guaranteed by the protocol, such as with UDP. Streams/segments are used by protocols such as TCP to guarantee end to end error free communication. A TCP stream is considered a data stream of bytes, not individual messages. If this single flow of bytes is too large to flow across the network in a single message, it can be fragmented into smaller pieces. A TCP segment would be an individual piece of the larger TCP stream. TCP streams offer many ""services"" for applications such as ordered delivery, guaranteed delivery, flow control, congestion avoidance, and even multiplexing.

As network engineers it's our job to ensure that end to end communication is available for the higher layers of our protocol stacks. Now that we know the correct terms for how data is encapsulated so that it can be transported across the network we should start to look at how this data fits across our network. How big are these TCP segments, datagrams, packets and frames flowing across our network? At first it may look like this doesn't matter but when a higher level protocol is trying to cram too much information into the pipes this can cause problems. Just picture connecting a garden hose to a fire hydrant. This is where MTU and MSS come into play.

MTU, Maximum Transmission Unit, is the maximum size of data that a network layer can forward. This means that MTU is/can be different for each layer (Ethernet MTU, IPv4 MTU). TCP uses MSS, Maximum Segment Size, to define the maximum size of data that it will include in an individual TCP segment which would make up a TCP stream. We will talk about MSS in a moment, for now let's focus on MTU.

Differentiating between the physical interface MTU (PHY MTU) and IP MTU can get a little confusing. The PHY MTU is the maximum allowed frame size (not counting the header) or in other words, the payload size. IP MTU is the maximum packet size allowed to transmit before fragmentation occurs. Increasing PHY MTU will also increase IP MTU. However decreasing IP MTU will not affect the interface PHY MTU. Why does this matter? In scenarios where we are adding additional headers such as GRE or MPLS. To accommodate the extra protocol overheard of something like GRE, you could lower the IP MTU by 24 bytes to leave room for the GRE overhead without exceeding the PHY MTU.

TCP MSS is the maximum size of data that TCP is willing to <strong>RECEIVE</strong> in a segment. When a TCP connection is established between two hosts they announce their TCP MSS to each other. It's interesting to note that TCP MSS isn't negotiated and doesn't necessarily have to match.

4/24/2014 14:33,Brocade MLX ACL Deny Logging,"I just spent 3 hours troubleshooting an ACL, well let me restate... I just spent 3 hours TRYING to troubleshoot an ACL on a Brocade MLX. My ACL had a <code>deny ip any any log</code> at the end. However, the logs were not showing anything, nothing, 'ACL Applied...ACL Removed...'. Very frustrating.

Anyway, after much Googling, deep in some obscure documentation I found out that there is a separate command which must be applied to the interface to enable the logging (which was already enabled in the ACL).

<code>ip access-group 199 in
ip access-group enable-deny-logging</code>

Some things that 'just work' on Cisco really make me scratch my head when working on Brocade equipment. Lesson learned, let's move on. Maybe this post and the tags will help some future Googler.",,
12/21/2013 6:37,Redistribute Connected,"I've been building a lab scenario out for my next Pluralsight course and I discovered some interesting (or at least new to me) behavior with Cisco OSPF. I've already known about the different OSPF router types (ABR, ASBR), but it never really clicked for me until I saw it in real life.

The lab setup is very simple, a Juniper EX4200 connected to two Cisco 1721s running OSPF. Since I'm doing the labs on the Juniper EX4200, I was going to preconfigure the Cisco routers to already have OSPF configured. I configured the L3 interfaces and a network statement for the physical and the RID loopback. I also configured a loopback interface so I could generate some extra routes to the Juniper. I thought I would keep things simple so I just added the 'redistribute connected' command under the OSPF configuration without adding additional network statements. (This is me being lazy.)

When I logged into the EX4200 to verify the routes were working I noticed that one of the loopback routes I configured was showing up as an OSPF external route [OSPF/150]:
<code>192.168.10.1/32 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:17, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.2.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
192.168.50.0/24 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:12, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.3.2 via ge-0/0/23.0
</code>

So I started digging into the Cisco router to see why it was displaying the RID loopback, which had a network statement as an OSPF internal route, and the one being redistributed was showing up as external. A quick show ip ospf command and I had my lightbulb moment:
<code>Cisco-RTR#sh ip ospf 1
Routing Process ""ospf 1"" with ID 2.2.2.2
Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes
Supports opaque LSA
Supports Link-local Signaling (LLS)
Supports area transit capability
<strong> It is an autonomous system boundary router
Redistributing External Routes from,
connected</strong>
Initial SPF schedule delay 5000 msecs</code>

That's when it hit me that the redistributed routes were automatically advertised as external. Which when I started thinking it made perfect sense. If we think about what the OSPF 'network' statement is actually doing; which is enabling OSPF and adding the interface(s) to the topology. Then it makes sense that my redistributed loopback interface wasn't actually part of the OSPF topology, it was just a network being advertised into the topology. I guess I was just thinking that since it was still a local interface on a router running OSPF that it wouldn't be considered 'external'. That's what I get for thinking. <strong>The ASBR function is to redistribute routes from other protocols, even if that protocol is directly connected.</strong>

When I was doing research into this behavior I found <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094707.shtml"" target=""_blank"">this Cisco link</a>. So, I added a network statement to cover my additional loopback interface. This corrected the route preference on the Juniper EX4200, but I noticed that the Cisco router still considered itself an ASBR. So even if you have network statements covering all of the interfaces on the router, if 'redistribute connected' is still configured then the router will act as an ASBR.

This might be a 'duh' moment for most other engineers, and when I look back, it is. But it was a lightbulb moment for me to really understand the Type 5 LSA and the function of the ASBR in OSPF.",,
12/11/2013 16:40,JNCIA-Junos Study Notes,"I recently took (and passed) the JN0-101 JNCIA-Junos exam. I spent my time studying and taking notes, but when it gets to crunch time I like to condense my notes into a quick study sheet. I use this study sheet to look at the day of the exam and right before I walk into the testing center. These aren't complete notes, they're only a summary that's useful for last minute studying and staying fresh. I've got a few notebooks in my office from various certifications, but this time I thought I would put my study sheet into an electronic format and share it with the world. A few thoughts on my notes first:

I like to write notes in the long hierarchy form because I am a visual creature. Every indentation level I see could be a new edit or set hierarchy. If I start in a particular hierarchy, I either talk about it in my notes or specify the [edit] level just as you would see in the CLI. Sometimes my curly brackets do not correctly align with the configuration. It makes no sense to waste 5 lines just for curly brackets.

I use < and > to identify variable names.
I use '/' to identify multiple options
If there is an optional command completion I list it in '( )'

4/26/2013 6:28,Things That Make My Life Easier,"As network engineers we live busy lives. We usually have multiple things happening and we have to remain agile to keep up with our daily work. I've slowly built a personal system which I use to help me stay on top of my mounting workload.
<h2>Notes</h2>
<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-873"" alt=""The Post-It System"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-300x225.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

Some people rely on the post-it note system. For me, this doesn't cut it. I am constantly juggling multiple projects and tasks, many of which are hurry up and wait scenarios. I work on a project and then have to be able to come back to it and pick back up where I left off. Or sometimes I need save a config snippet I did, or templates I've used to deploy port configurations. Which brings me to one of my favorite (yet anti-climatic) tools, <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a>.
<h2>Notepad++</h2>
I use Notepad++ for multiple reasons, one of the biggest is tabs. I have created a folder (obviously called Notes), which I save all of my information to. When I get a call, or start to work a ticket, I immediately open a new tab (Ctrl+N) and start to work. When I'm done I can look at it and either close the tab without saving, or save it to my Notes folder. I like having multiple tabs open because I reference some things multiple times a day and it makes it much easier than constantly browsing for a file.

The next big reason I use Notepad++ is for the column editing mode. Instead of deleting or inserting at the beginning of each line 10 times, you can use Column Editing mode to do it all at once. To do this just Alt+Click in the document. This feature along with search and replace makes it easy to take the output from a show command, modify it with search+replace, and turn it into a script to paste back into the device.

There is also a handy <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-compare/"" target=""_blank"">Compare Plugin for Notepad++</a> that can be useful for comparing config changes.
<h2>CLI</h2>

As network engineers we spend most of our time at the Command Line Interface. This involves a lot of time spent with terminal emulation programs. I like <a href=""http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"" target=""_blank"">PuTTY</a> and it's great in a pinch, but if you work in a large environment I strongly suggest you check out <a href=""http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/"" target=""_blank"">SecureCRT</a>. It is pricey ($100 for 1yr of updates), but I feel it is an investment well worth it. Well managed tabs and organized saved sessions are absolute life-savers.

One of the biggest things I've learned to do with SecureCRT is setup auto-logging. To do this you have to edit the session options and you can specify the log file name and how you want to save your logs using convenient variables. I do this in-case I fat-finger a command and generally having logs is always a good thing. It's also an easy way to capture the crazy output that is ""show tech"" for TAC cases.
<h2>Task Management</h2>
The final tool I'm going to mention is a webapp I use to manage my project tasks. There are plenty of apps out there. The one I've settled on using is <a href=""https://www.nirvanahq.com/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>. It is a Getting Things Done (GTD) based web app and also has an iOS client. I like it primarily because I can group my tasks into projects. Being GTD based, it has a folder/view for Next items (stuff I need to be doing now) and Project folders/views (for stuff that isn't immediate). I also like that it has Contexts and areas to filter your tasks (great for separating home and work tasks and projects).
<h2>The Take-Away</h2>
Build yourself a system. I'm sure you have plenty of issues, methods, and opinions that make every situation unique. These are the tools I've discovered that best suite me, but there are plenty more out there. Don't settle for mediocrity when it comes to tools you use on a daily basis, craftsmen don't and you shouldn't either.",,
8/14/2012 7:24,Cisco VACL for IDS Monitoring,"Instead of using a SPAN or VSPAN port to capture traffic for an IDS it is more efficient to target specific traffic for monitoring. This can be completed at a much more granular level by using a VACL. VACLs are more efficient because they only target specific traffic and they are also enforced in hardware, so the performance impact is lower.  To setup a VACL for IDS monitoring you need 4 main components: an access-list identifying interesting traffic, a VLAN access-map to capture the traffic, a VLAN filter to apply the access-map, and a capture port to send the traffic to.

You actually need 2 ACLs, one to identify interesting traffic and another to permit all traffic, the latter will be crucial in building the access-map.
<pre>ip access-list extended MONITOR
  permit ip 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
  permit ip host 198.51.100.23 any
  permit ip host 198.51.100.24 any
exit

ip access-list extended ALL_TRAFFIC
  permit ip any any
exit</pre>

We then use these ACLs to build our VLAN access-map.
<pre>vlan access-map MONITOR 10
  match ip address MONITOR
  action forward capture
vlan access-map MONITOR 20
  match ip address ALL_TRAFFIC
  action forward
exit</pre>
The key here is the ""action forward capture"", this will continue to forward the packet and also send it to our capture port. We also must add another statement so that all other legitimate traffic will continue to be forwarded. If we did not, traffic that wasn't matched as interesting by the first ACL would just get dropped by the access-map.

Next we need to apply our access-map to the VLANs we wish to monitor.
<pre>vlan filter MONITOR vlan-list 6,28,30,58</pre>

And finally configure our capture port which will have the IDS tap connected to it.
<pre>interface Gi1/20
  description IDS Port
  switchport capture allowed vlan 6,28,30,58
  switchport capture</pre>

""Switchport capture"" has some interesting effects on the interface. Unless you want to apply dot1q tags no further interface config is necessary. If you want to apply the dot1q tags, configure the port as a trunk without negotiation. The capture port only supports egress traffic; if you you do a show interface you will see (along with only packets output): 
<pre>6509#  sh int gi1/20
GigabitEthernet1/20 is up, line protocol is down (monitoring)
  ...</pre>

Finally, we can verify our config by checking the access-map and the vlan filter:
<pre>6509#sh vlan access-map MONITOR
Vlan access-map ""MONITOR""  10
        match: ip address MONITOR
        action: forward capture
Vlan access-map ""MONITOR""  20
        match: ip address ALL_TRAFFIC
        action: forward
6509#sh vlan filter
VLAN Map MONITOR:
        Configured on VLANs:  6,28,30,58
            Active on VLANs:  6,28,30,58</pre>

How true. I made plans, big plans. CCIE baby! Yea, I can do this! And then life happened. I'm not complaining, it's all about priorities right? And right now I've got an 18 month old little ball of energy bouncing around my living room which takes priority over all. Anyway, I had grandiose plans to tackle my CCIE, which I downgraded to CCNP after realizing that, without employer support, there was just no way I could afford to sit the lab exam. The CCNP exam isn't really cheap either, and I just got an email stating my CCNA expires in March. 

So I've decided in an effort to save my CCNA and secure another certification at the same time, I'm just going to renew it via the CCNA Security exam. I took an assessment on Cisco.com and scored a 68% without any studying, so I think if I brush up on my VPNs I'll be doing pretty good. I find it kind of funny that I had planned to tackle the CCIE but instead will be taking another CCNA exam. But alas, life happens. Right now I've got a solid job, it's just that my employer puts little if any stock in certifications. 

So I'll start cramming for my CCNA Security (be expecting some IPSEC posts to follow soon), and I'll look to take the CCNP exams when I find a spare $600 in the sofa cushions.",,
2/21/2012 20:21,Rethinking Scripting,"I recently wrote a post stating I was beginning learning scripting to aid in my network administration tasks. I had initially stated I was going to use Perl for this. Then I tried to write a script at work, but I'm not allowed to install unauthorized software on my machine, much less multiple machines or servers. We are also a Windows shop, so unfortunately no built-in scripting for me. Or so I thought. I overheard our Windows admin group talking about their Powershell scripts and this got me thinking. Can I use Powershell to write scripts for network device administration? It would make a great platform mostly because its authorized and it's built-in to Windows 7 and Server 2008. I started to do some research and one of the first things I came across was the use of the command line version of PuTTY called PLink to SSH into boxes and then pass commands. I started down this path, but it wasn't long before I began running into problems. Problems either passing commands through PLink or being unable to capture the entire output when running multiple commands. I had to find a better way.

I did some more research and discovered the use of a library called <a href=""http://huddledmasses.org/scriptable-ssh-from-powershell/"" target=""_blank"">SharpSSH in Powershell</a>. Now this is what I was looking for. In his post, Joel wrote a few Powershell functions using the SharpSSH library. All I have to do is store the DLLs some place and update the script with their location. The Invoke-SSH function he wrote closely mimics Expect scripts. You run a command and then 'expect' the prompt. This allows the function to know when the command is complete, something I was seriously hurting for using PLink.

I'm a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel, so what I did was take Joel's functions and use them in a manner that would benefit myself and maybe other network admins.?ÿLet me walk you through a quick script I wrote utilizing Joel's functions:

First I want to create my SSH session:
<pre>New-SshSession root 192.168.1.1 ## Will be prompted for password
if (Receive-SSH '%')
{
#root prompt
Write-Host ""Logged in as root. Starting CLI.""
$a = Invoke-SSH ""cli"" '&gt;'
$rootlogin = 'true'
}</pre>
Now you may ask why I created the if statement to check if I received the % prompt. If you're a Juniper engineer then you would know that % is the shell prompt you receive if you log in as root. I know I hard-coded sending the root username, but in future posts I will share a snippet that will allow for more dynamic entry of username/password combos, and if it happens to be the root user, then we would like to send CLI to start the CLI and enter operational mode. The Invoke-SSH function sends command 'cli' and expects the operational prompt &gt;. I used the variable to call the function because I didn't want it to write any output at this time so I capture it in the variable and sit on it. I also set a variable to true if logged in as root, for use later in the script.

Next I want to download the entire config for my backup folder:
<pre>#Invoke-SSH outputs the command(first line), the output, and the expected string line(EOF)
$a = Invoke-SSH ""show config | no-more"" '&gt;'
$a|out-file showconfig.txt
Write-Host ""Config Backup Complete.""</pre>
Here I use a variable to call the Invoke-SSH function and send the command ""show config | no-more"". Once the command is done executing we should be back at the operational mode prompt, therefore I expect &gt;. I then use out-file to write the variable to a text file, and write-host to display a little status message.

I then want to cleanly close out the session:
<pre>#Extra exit when logged in as root.
if ($rootlogin='true')
{
Write-Host ""Exiting CLI.""
Send-SSH exit
}
Write-Host ""Terminating Session.""
Remove-SshSession #Will send exit.</pre>
If I previously set the variable of rootlogin to 'true', then my I need an extra exit to get back to the shell prompt before my final exit closing the session.

This post is not intended to be an introduction to Powershell or scripting in general. There are better places for that. I just wanted to share an example of how you can use Powershell + SharpSSH to make your life a little easier. This script was written for Junos devices, however it could easily be modified for IOS devices, or any device for that matter.This example was a basic, single device, config backup script. I have some great snippets I will be sharing in future posts that can bolt on to make a more powerful script. 

If you want the entire script, including Joel's functions:

Before I got the job I had to give a short ""practice teach"" on a topic of my choice. I picked network cabling since it would be fast and easy for me to cover. I thought I'd share my slide presentation from the quick class. There isn't much 'meat' to the slides because I was trying not to lean on the slides and instead do more speaking. The practice teach went well so I thought I'd share the slides, this is also my first attempt at using <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/"" target=""_blank"">SlideShare</a> so it's a good experiment for me.

1/13/2012 14:26,Authenticating Cisco VoIP Phones via Dot1x,"If anyone has attempted to authenticate Cisco VoIP phones via Dot1x and Microsoft Network Policy Server then you know there are a few small issues. First the username that the phones send to the Radius server exceeds the length allowed by Windows. Secondly it is not a straightforward setup to get the phones to properly authenticate. 

First in Windows Server 2008, Microsoft removed support for EAP-MD5 authentication. However you can re-add this support to NPS by modifying the registry according to <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922574"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft KB922574</a>. 

Because phones are the exception to my normal radius policies, I used a separate Connection Request Policy for VOIP phones. I created one with the condition to match UserName = ""CP-*"". This should ensure that this policy only applies to Cisco phones(because all their usernames start with CP-*). 

Next we need to shorten the username which the phone sends so that we can match it to a valid Windows Domain Account. To do this we use the separate VOIP Connection Request Policy. Under Settings &gt; Attributes we need to override the Username attribute using a match and replace. For example we find ""CP-7975G-"" and replace with """". This will essentially remove the first part of the username and leave us with the ""SEP..."" username. A separate match will have to be configured for every model of Cisco phone which needs to be authenticated.

Finally we need to configure the authentication methods. Under Settings &gt; Authentication Methods we want to Override Network Policy Authentication Settings. We add the EAP Type ""MD5-Challenge"" and then check Encrypted Authentication (CHAP). This allows us to use a single Network Policy and override it when necessary using our VOIP Connection Request Policy. 

The only thing left to do is ensure that a Windows Domain Account is created and the Account Password is Stored using Reversible Encryption. Then enter the account password as the MD5 shared secret on the phone, turn Dot1x on the port and you're good to go. If you're using a Cisco switch, ensure you have dual-host authentication enabled so you can also authenticate a computer hanging off the phone.

If you need a little help troubleshooting NPS and can't find events in MS Event Viewer from CMD Prompt, Run As Admin, type: ""auditpol /set /subcategory:""Network Policy Server"" /success:enable /failure:enable"". NPS logs are in Event Viewer/CustomViews/Server Roles/Network Policy Server",,
2/12/2013 9:56,Cisco AAA,"Controlling who can play with you networking equipment is somewhat important. If you run the kind of network where you don't care who can log in and lab on your gear then you can probably skip this post. But for the rest of us, I'm going to cover Cisco's AAA features and what good they are to us as network engineers/admins. 

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, and is most commonly used to control administrative access to our boxes. Authentication is all about identity; can you who you are by providing the correct password? Authorization is kind of like the hall pass; I know you're allowed in this building, but are you allowed down this hall? And finally Accounting is big brother's spy eye, keeping track of what you're doing and how long you spent doing it. 

Now AAA isn't just used to control admin access, it actually can operate in two types or modes. The first mode is <strong>Character</strong> mode and is used to control remote admin access for line(vty, console) or EXEC mode commands. The other mode is <strong>Packet</strong> mode and is used to control remote network access for things such as VPN or PPP users. AAA can also either local(internal) or external services. Local or internal services use an internal database, while the external service can use either Cisco ACS and TACACS+ or another type of control server using RADIUS. Because AAA and TACACS+ are Cisco systems/protocols they obviously offer more robustness over the standard RADIUS implementations. Most notably, TACACS+ separates all 3 functions of AAA to allow for more granularity while RADIUS combines Authentication and Authorization. Also, TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet body, while RADIUS only encrypts the password attribute portion of a Access-Request packet.

Configuration of AAA is fairly straight forward. You have to enable AAA with the <strong>aaa new-model</strong> global config command, and then specify your TACACS+ servers using the <strong>tacacs-server host &lt;ip&gt; key &lt;password&gt;</strong> global config command. From there you can then enable each facet of AAA as desired. 

To configure login authentication to use all configured TACACS+ servers with a local database as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local</strong>
To configure enable accounting to use all configured TACACS+ servers with the configured enable secret as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable</strong>

I would go into a little detail regarding authorization, but unless you have a teams that are only allowed to issue certain commands, such as a NOC only being allowed to configure or reset certain settings, then I feel that authorization is useless. You can Google to the Cisco docs if you think you really need this feature.

To configure accounting of sessions and commands entered to a TACACS+ server, use the commands:
<strong>aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 0 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
(We don't use any any privilege levels other than 0 or 15, but if you wish you can specify any value from 0-15).

So there you have a high-level overview of Cisco's AAA features. There is a lot of granularity in the options and I strongly suggest you read the documentation if you're looking for a specific feature or option. I mean, it's not really a blog post if I just re-write Cisco's docs on AAA. ",,
8/30/2012 7:43,Finding Cisco 6500 Serial Numbers,"Learned something new today. To display the IDPROMs (serial numbers) for FRUs (Field Replaceable Units):

<pre>show idprom {all | frutype | interface &lt;interface&gt; &lt;slot&gt;} [detail]</pre>

Some of the FRU types available: 
   backplane
   module &lt;slot&gt;
   rp
   power-supply
   supervisor

To find the chassis serial number use: 
<pre>show idprom backplane</pre>

Will give the output similar to:
<pre>6509#sh idprom backplane
IDPROM for backplane #0
  (FRU is 'Catalyst 6500 9-slot backplane')
  OEM String = 'Cisco Systems'
  Product Number = 'WS-C6509'
  Serial Number = 'ABC12345678'
  Manufacturing Assembly Number = '12-3456-78'
  Manufacturing Assembly Revision = 'A0'
  Hardware Revision = 3.0
  Current supplied (+) or consumed (-) =  -</pre>

Definitely comes in handy for opening TAC cases.",,
9/11/2015 20:38,Quality of Service,"Our networks are basically application delivery platforms, or service delivery platforms, that service could be a website, a database, or a phone call. Quality of Service isn't necessarily a thing, or protocol by itself. Instead QoS is more of a group of ideas, technologies, or architecture which when individually implemented can help to improve or guantee the quality of a service which the nework is delivering.

The whole reason for QoS goes back to bandwidth and the networking basic of TDM vs packet-switched networks. Within a TDM network, an individual circuit has guaranteed bandwidth. While on a packet-switched network different traffic is switched across shared circuits. A prime example?ÿis PRI vs SIP. A PRI T1 has 23 dedicated B Channels which can be used for individual calls while a SIP trunk using G.711 codec would use 85kbps per call. Notice that the SIP trunk doesn't have dedicated channels for each call, only that each call consumes a certain amount of bandwidth. The limitation of course being the network bandwidth, which is where QoS features come into play.",,

6/2/2015 20:32,Raspberry Pi Home Calendar,"I bought a Raspberry Pi a while back with grand delusions of a digital signage/home calendar display for our kitchen. After coming up short on solutions I eventually gave up and boxed it all back up. Well I stumbled across a solution the other day that gave me reason to dig the Pi back out and get that display working.
<h2>The Display Solution</h2>
The solution I finally found that warranted display in our kitchen was <a href=""http://designelemental.net/mpanel/"" target=""_blank"">mPanel</a>. mPanel allows integration with iCal links, Weather Underground API for custom weather, links to Flickr for beautiful background photos, and does all of this in a beautiful package. Setting up mPanel is fairly straightforward. You'll need to request a free API from Weather Underground for local weather, the display looks amazing and even has red alert boxes in case of storm warnings. I linked it to my Google iCal URL to get a feed of calendar events, however I noticed that if there is an alert configured it would hide the event name, this is probably something I'll circle back to later. I also created a Flickr album with photos around our backyard to cycle through as backgrounds.?ÿ Once I had mPanel all configured, it was a simple matter of making it display properly on the Pi.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/home-display.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1181"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/home-display-e1433174693577-300x186.jpg"" alt=""home display"" width=""300"" height=""186"" /></a>
<h2>Full Resolution Display</h2>
I already had my Pi running previously on a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/"" target=""_blank"">NOOBS/Raspbian</a> image. The first thing I had to fix was the HDMI output on my TV had black bars on the sides and wasn't utilizing true full screen. This was a simple fix by disabling overscan.

1. From CLI:
<code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code>
2. Remove top comment so that:
<code>disable_overscan=1</code>
3. Update NOOBS config at bottom so that:
<code>#overscan_left=24
#overscan_right=24
#overscan_top=16
#overscan_bottom=16
disable_overscan=1</code>
4. Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.
5. <code>sudo reboot</code>

I was then able to start the GUI full screen open Midori and view my mPanel page in all its glory. Except that it would occasionally hang and not refresh. I realized that the full GUI was pegging CPU utilization at 100%, so I thought it would be better if I could launch Midori directly from the CLI. After some research I finally found a solution that was lightweight enough.

The first thing I had to do was install the <a href=""https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/projects/matchbox"" target=""_blank"">Matchbox window manager,</a> x11-xserver utilities to keep the display on 24/7, and unclutter to hide the mouse:
<code>sudo apt-get install matchbox
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils
sudo apt-get install unclutter</code>
Then I created a startup script
<code>sudo nano startMidori</code>
Which looked like:
<code>#!/bin/sh
xset -dpms?ÿ # disable DPMS (EnergyStar) features
xset s off?ÿ # disable screen saver
xset s noblank?ÿ # don't blank the video service
sudo unclutter &amp;
matchbox-window-manager &amp;
midori -e Fullscreen -a http://startupsite.com</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.
I was then able to run the script to open Midori full screen to my mPanel page:
<code>xinit ./startMidori</code>
<h2>Automate It</h2>
Now that I had a working script and a working display I just needed a way to automate the login process and auto-execute my script. The first thing we have to do is automate the login process. To do this we need to make some changes to the /etc/inittab file.

Open the file:
<code>sudo nano /etc/inittab</code>
Navigate in the file to the following line:
<code>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1</code>
Put a comment before that line to disable getty:
<code>#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1</code>
Right after that line add the following line to run the login program with Pi user:
<code>1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 &lt;/dev/tty1 &gt;/dev/tty1 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now to just run my Midori script after login we will edit the profile:
<code>sudo nano /etc/profile</code>
Add the following line to the end of the file:
<code>xinit ./startMidori</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now just reboot the Pi one more time (sudo reboot) and enjoy your automated calendar goodness.

Here is my Pi until I get around to purchasing a case and hiding it behind the TV:

6/1/2015 9:56,Raspberry Pi Home Calendar,"I bought a Raspberry Pi a while back with grand delusions of a digital signage/home calendar display for our kitchen. After coming up short on solutions I eventually gave up and boxed it all back up. Well I stumbled across a solution the other day that gave me reason to dig the Pi back out and get that display working.
<h2>The Display Solution</h2>
The solution I finally found that warranted display in our kitchen was <a href=""http://designelemental.net/mpanel/"" target=""_blank"">mPanel</a>. mPanel allows integration with iCal links, Weather Underground API for custom weather, links to Flickr for beautiful background photos, and does all of this in a beautiful package. Setting up mPanel is fairly straightforward. You'll need to request a free API from Weather Underground for local weather, the display looks amazing and even has red alert boxes in case of storm warnings. I linked it to my Google iCal URL to get a feed of calendar events, however I noticed that if there is an alert configured it would hide the event name, this is probably something I'll circle back to later. I also created a Flickr album with photos around our backyard to cycle through as backgrounds.?ÿ Once I had mPanel all configured, it was a simple matter of making it display properly on the Pi.
<h2>Full Resolution Display</h2>
I already had my Pi running previously on a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/"" target=""_blank"">NOOBS/Raspbian</a> image. The first thing I had to fix was the HDMI output on my TV had black bars on the sides and wasn't utilizing true full screen. This was a simple fix by disabling overscan.

1. From CLI:
<code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</code>
2. Remove top comment so that:
<code>disable_overscan=1</code>
3. Update NOOBS config at bottom so that:
<code>#overscan_left=24
#overscan_right=24
#overscan_top=16
#overscan_bottom=16
disable_overscan=1</code>
4. Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.
5. <code>sudo reboot</code>

I was then able to start the GUI full screen open Midori and view my mPanel page in all its glory. Except that it would occasionally hang and not refresh. I realized that the full GUI was pegging CPU utilization at 100%, so I thought it would be better if I could launch Midori directly from the CLI. After some research I finally found a solution that was lightweight enough.

The first thing I had to do was install the <a href=""https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/projects/matchbox"" target=""_blank"">Matchbox window manager</a> and x11-xserver utilities to keep the display on 24/7:
<code>sudo apt-get install matchbox
sudo apt-get install x11-xserver-utils</code>
Then I created a startup script
<code>sudo nano startMidori</code>
Which looked like:
<code>#!/bin/sh
xset -dpms?ÿ # disable DPMS (EnergyStar) features
xset s off?ÿ # disable screen saver
xset s noblank?ÿ # don't blank the video service
matchbox-window-manager &amp;
midori -e Fullscreen -a http://startupsite.com</code>
Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

I was then able to run the script to open Midori full screen to my mPanel page:
<code>xinit ./startMidori</code>

<h2>Automate It</h2>
Now that I had a working script and a working display I just needed a way to automate the login process and auto-execute my script.

The first thing we have to do is automate the login process. To do this we need to make some changes to the /etc/inittab file.

Open the file:

sudo nano /etc/inittab

Navigate in the file to the following line:

1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1

Put a comment before that line to disable getty:

#1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 115200 tty1

Right after that line add the following line to run the login program with Pi user:

1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f pi tty1 &lt;/dev/tty1 &gt;/dev/tty1 2&gt;&amp;1

Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now to just run my Midori script after login we will edit the profile:

sudo nano /etc/profile

Add the following line to the end of the file:

xinit ./startMidori

Ctrl+X to save/exit. Y to save.

Now just reboot the Pi one more time (sudo reboot) and enjoy your automated calendar goodness.

Installation was fairly straightforward. I had broke the tabs off my switch console, but Joe was kind enough to include some ""L"" brackets which had been hammered to roughly 45 degrees which made for a great replacement. I also ordered the two boots to replace my dissolved leather ones. The console plate came with instructions but the boots were just there. I just folded them like the previous boots and super-glued them in place. I'm also debating leaving off my driver side cup holder, I am enjoying the extra knee room.

You can see from the first picture there is a bit of a gap at the top of the plate, I'm going to email Joe as I'm sure this is an installation error on my part. Overall I'm very excited about the new clean look. I would highly recommend this combo.",,

3/31/2015 15:53,Adding Support for Wordpress Post Formats,"I use the AlienWP Origin theme on this site, and I'm quite happy with it. I've recently changed the way I share things online (I cancelled my social media accounts), so I wanted a way to share other formats on my website, sort of like Tumblr format. I thought the built-in Wordpress Post Formats would be a great way to accomplish this. Until I realized my Origin theme doesn't support them. So what I did is extract the theme to create a child theme (something I should have done some time ago), finally after some searching and kludging I was able to find a working solution. The information is easily found online, in various formats, but for my lack of Wordpress experience it took a little trial and error to find the relatively simply solution.

<h3>Child Theme</h3>
The first thing I did was create a child theme from the Origin them. They offer this on their website but you have to pay for a support subscription. I'm sorry I'm not going to pay for a blank child version of a theme you offer for free under the GPL. I did leave all references to AlienWP and their Origin theme. To create the child theme I created a file <code>style.css</code>:
<pre>/**
* Theme Name: Origin Child
* Theme URI: http://alienwp.com/themes/origin/
* Description: Origin is a minimalistic theme with responsive layout. The theme supports custom header and background, plus a number of extra settings: link color picker, typography options, and a nice selection of Google fonts - built into the new WordPress theme customizer.
* Version: 0.5.6
* Author: AlienWP
* Author URI: http://alienwp.com
* Template: origin
* Tags: flexible-width, theme-options, threaded-comments, microformats, translation-ready, rtl-language-support, one-column, two-columns, right-sidebar, sticky-post, custom-background, featured-images
* License: GNU General Public License v2.0
* License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
*
*/</pre>

Next I created a <code>functions.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
function theme_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
	wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',
        array('parent-style')
    );
}
?&gt;</pre>

I also had to copy the <code>index.php</code> file to the child folder. Because I don't like constantly updating files, you can go ahead and create 2 empty files for now, <code>content.php</code> and also <code>content-quote.php</code>, or you can create these as you go and upload them individually to your theme folder.

The rest I'm going to generalize for the sake of simplicity, it easily applies to any theme.
<h3>Adding Post Format Support</h3>
The first step necessary is to add support for the post formats to your <code>functions.php</code> file:

<pre>add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'link', 'image', 'quote', 'video' ) );
	add_post_type_support( 'page', 'post-formats' );</pre>

Next go into your <code>index.php</code> file and <b>extract</b> the entire loop. Mine started with <code>&lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;</code> and ended with <code>&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;</code>. So cut out everything between those lines and paste it into your <code>content.php</code> file. This is used when a post has a non-standard post format specified.
Then go into your <code>index.php</code> file again and where that empty space is where you removed your original loop code, paste this new code:

<pre>&lt;?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?&gt;</pre>

This replaces your loop with a call to individual content-<i>whatever</i>.php formats, or calls the default content.php format depending if it's specified or not. Next for each format type you will need a content- file. For example we will use <code>content-quote.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
		/**
		* The template for displaying posts in the Quote post format
		*

3/31/2015 15:52,Adding Support for Wordpress Post Formats,"I use the AlienWP Origin theme on this site, and I'm quite happy with it. I've recently changed the way I share things online (I cancelled my social media accounts), so I wanted a way to share other formats on my website, sort of like Tumblr format. I thought the built-in Wordpress Post Formats would be a great way to accomplish this. Until I realized my Origin theme doesn't support them. So what I did is extract the theme to create a child theme (something I should have done some time ago), finally after some searching and kludging I was able to find a working solution. The information is easily found online, in various formats, but for my lack of Wordpress experience it took a little trial and error to find the relatively simply solution.

<h3>Child Theme</h3>
The first thing I did was create a child theme from the Origin them. They offer this on their website but you have to pay for a support subscription. I'm sorry I'm not going to pay for a blank child version of a theme you offer for free under the GPL. I did leave all references to AlienWP and their Origin theme. To create the child theme I created a file <code>style.css</code>:
<pre>/**
* Theme Name: Origin Child
* Theme URI: http://alienwp.com/themes/origin/
* Description: Origin is a minimalistic theme with responsive layout. The theme supports custom header and background, plus a number of extra settings: link color picker, typography options, and a nice selection of Google fonts - built into the new WordPress theme customizer.
* Version: 0.5.6
* Author: AlienWP
* Author URI: http://alienwp.com
* Template: origin
* Tags: flexible-width, theme-options, threaded-comments, microformats, translation-ready, rtl-language-support, one-column, two-columns, right-sidebar, sticky-post, custom-background, featured-images
* License: GNU General Public License v2.0
* License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
*
*/</pre>

Next I created a <code>functions.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
function theme_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
	wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',
        array('parent-style')
    );
}
?&gt;</pre>

I also had to copy the <code>index.php</code> file to the child folder. Because I don't like constantly updating files, you can go ahead and create 2 empty files for now, <code>content.php</code> and also <code>content-quote.php</code>, or you can create these as you go and upload them individually to your theme folder.

The rest I'm going to generalize for the sake of simplicity, it easily applies to any theme.
<h3>Adding Post Format Support</h3>
The first step necessary is to add support for the post formats to your <code>functions.php</code> file:

<pre>add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'link', 'image', 'quote', 'video' ) );
	add_post_type_support( 'page', 'post-formats' );</pre>

Next go into your <code>index.php</code> file and <b>extract</b> the entire loop. Mine started with <code>&lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;</code> and ended with <code>&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;</code>. So cut out everything between those lines and paste it into your <code>content.php</code> file. This is used when a post has a non-standard post format specified.
Then go into your <code>index.php</code> file again and where that empty space is where you removed your original loop code, paste this new code:

<pre>&lt;?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?&gt;</pre>

This replaces your loop with a call to individual content-<i>whatever</i>.php formats, or calls the default content.php format depending if it's specified or not. Next for each format type you will need a content- file. For example we will use <code>content-quote.php</code>:
<pre>&lt;?php
		/**
		* The template for displaying posts in the Quote post format
		*
		*/
		?&gt;        
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>

Believe it or not it really is that simple. At this point you should be able to go to Add New post and select the Quote format, when you publish it you should see it on your front page with the specialized styling. From here you create content files for each post format and style them as you wish. If you have any questions hit up the comments.

EDIT:

&lt;div id=""post-&lt;?php the_ID(); ?&gt;"" class=""&lt;?php hybrid_entry_class(); ?&gt;""&gt;
	&lt;?php do_atomic( 'open_entry' ); // origin_open_entry ?&gt;
        &lt;div class=""entry-summary""&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
	&lt;blockquote:before&gt;
		&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;
	&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-summary --&gt;
	&lt;?php do_atomic( 'close_entry' ); // origin_close_entry ?&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .hentry --&gt;
&lt;?php do_atomic( 'after_entry' ); // origin_after_entry ?&gt;</pre>",,

Next I created a <code>functions.php</code>:
<code>&lt;?php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );
function theme_enqueue_styles() {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );
	wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',
        get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',
        array('parent-style')
    );
}
?&gt;</code>

I also had to copy the <code>index.php</code> file to the child folder. Because I don't like constantly updating files, you can go ahead and create 2 empty files for now, <code>content.php</code> and also <code>content-quote.php</code>, or you can create these as you go and upload them individually to your theme folder.

The rest I'm going to generalize for the sake of simplicity, it easily applies to any theme.
<h3>Adding Post Format Support</h3>
The first step necessary is to add support for the post formats to your <code>functions.php</code> file:

<code>add_theme_support( 'post-formats', array( 'aside', 'gallery', 'link', 'image', 'quote', 'video' ) );
	add_post_type_support( 'page', 'post-formats' );</code>

Next go into your <code>index.php</code> file and <b>extract</b> the entire loop. Mine started with <code>&lt;?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?&gt;</code> and ended with <code>&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;</code>. So cut out everything between those lines and paste it into your <code>content.php</code> file. This is used when a post has a non-standard post format specified.
Then go into your <code>index.php</code> file again and where that empty space is where you removed your original loop code, paste this new code:

<code>&lt;?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?&gt;</code>

This replaces your loop with a call to individual content-<i>whatever</i>.php formats, or calls the default content.php format depending if it's specified or not. Next for each format type you will need a content- file. For example we will use <code>content-quote.php</code>:
<code>&lt;?php
		/**
		* The template for displaying posts in the Quote post format
		*
		*/
		?&gt;        
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
Believe it or not it really is that simple. At this point you should be able to go to Add New post and select the Quote format, when you publish it you should see it on your front page with the specialized styling. From here you create content files for each post format and style them as you wish.",,

I've recently changed the way I share things online (I cancelled my social media accounts), so I wanted a way to share other formats on my website, sort of like Tumblr format. I thought the built-in Wordpress Post Formats would be a great way to accomplish this. Until I realized my Origin theme doesn't support them. So what I did is extract the theme to create a child theme (something I should have done some time ago), finally after some searching and kludging I was able to find a working solution. The information is easily found online, in various formats, but for my lack of Wordpress experience it took a little trial and error to find the relatively simply solution.

<h3>Child Theme</h3>
The first thing I did was create a child theme from the Origin them. They offer this on their website but you have to pay for a support subscription. I'm sorry I'm not going to pay for a blank child version of a theme you offer for free under the GPL. I did leave all references to AlienWP and their Origin theme. To create the child theme I created a file <code>style.css</code>:
<code>
/**
* Theme Name: Origin Child
* Theme URI: http://alienwp.com/themes/origin/
* Description: Origin is a minimalistic theme with responsive layout. The theme supports custom header and background, plus a number of extra settings: link color picker, typography options, and a nice selection of Google fonts - built into the new WordPress theme customizer.

3/31/2015 15:14,Adding Support for Wordpress Post Formats,"I use the AlienWP Origin theme on this site, and I'm quite happy with it. I've recently changed the way I share things online (I cancelled my social media accounts), so I wanted a way to share other formats on my website, sort of like Tumblr format. I thought the built-in Wordpress Post Formats would be a great way to accomplish this. Until I realized my Origin theme doesn't support them. So what I did is extract the theme to create a child theme (something I should have done some time ago), finally after some searching and kludging I was able to find a working solution. The information is easily found online, in various formats, but for my lack of Wordpress experience it took a little trial and error to find the relatively simply solution.

The first thing I did was create a child theme from the Origin them. They offer this on their website but you have to pay for a support subscription. I'm sorry I'm not going to pay for a blank child version of a theme you offer for free under the GPL. I did leave all references to AlienWP and their Origin theme. To create the child theme I created a file <code>style.css</code>:
<code>
/**
* Theme Name: Origin Child
* Theme URI: http://alienwp.com/themes/origin/
* Description: Origin is a minimalistic theme with responsive layout. The theme supports custom header and background, plus a number of extra settings: link color picker, typography options, and a nice selection of Google fonts - built into the new WordPress theme customizer.
* Version: 0.5.6
* Author: AlienWP
* Author URI: http://alienwp.com
* Template: origin
* Tags: flexible-width, theme-options, threaded-comments, microformats, translation-ready, rtl-language-support, one-column, two-columns, right-sidebar, sticky-post, custom-background, featured-images
* License: GNU General Public License v2.0
* License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
*
*/
</code>
Next I created a <code>functions.php</code>:
<code>
<?php
/**
 * @package Origin
 * @subpackage Functions
 * @version 0.5.6

add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'theme_enqueue_styles' );

3/30/2015 13:55,Gaggia New Baby Steam Wand,"We recently purchased a refurbished Gaggia New Baby espresso machine and grinder. We've been very pleased with the results (and the cost). The one complaint (and the only one so far) was the stock steam wand. It did a great job at making foam, though more than we care for and it was a pain to keep clean. I saw online that it was possible to replace the steam wand on a Gaggia Classic with one from a Rancilio Silvia so I took the chance and purchased a Rancilio Sivlia steam wand for $15 from eBay. What follows are the general instructions necessary to make this swap work on a Gaggia New Baby.

First, remove the water tank and disconnect the power. Then remove the two screws from the back side. The are located underneath where the water tank was located on the black plastic. No need to remove the ones on the silver plastic.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1092"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2608"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next pull the steam control knob straight up to remove it and remove the screw at the top of the machine.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1093"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2609"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next lay the machine on its back with the bottom facing up. There are 2 screws underneath, next to the group head.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1091"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2607"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next stand the machine upright and slowly pull the black cover straight up to remove it from the rest of the machine. There is enough slack in the wiring harness which allowed me to keep everything connected, I just laid it aside. You'll see where the hose connecting to the steam wand is located and there is a small plate with 2 screws. Remove the screws and slide the plate up. The factory wand will pull up through the housing.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1087"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2598"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

The next part is probably the hardest step, but that isn't saying much. There is a plastic clip securing the wand to the round ball and the hose. I found the easiest way to do this was the secure the wand in my left and use my thumb and forefinger to put upward pressure on the ball. Then take a small flat head screwdriver and use it to push the 3 clips inside the ball toward the center. Keeping the upward pressure will hold them as work you way around to all 3 clips inside. I've tried to capture this as best as possible but it was hard to get a good shot.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1088"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2600"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

With the clip removed slide it down the factory wand and pull out the factory wand.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1089"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2602"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

I saw on some videos that the Rancilio Silivia wand had a flared end that sometimes had to be ""flattened"" in order to remove the large factory nut. Mine was not flared and the nut and washer easily slid off when I unscrewed the nozzle. I just put the plastic clip onto the Rancilio wand and pushed it back into the ball.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1090"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2603"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Re-assemble in opposite order. Secure the cover on the steam wand, put the case back on. 2 screws underneath next to the group head, one under the steam control knob, finally the last 2 screws on the black plastic underneath where the water tank sits. Then just screw the nozzle back onto the Rancilio wand, and give her a spin.

The one complaint (and the only one so far) was the stock steam wand. It did a great job at making foam, though more than we care for and it was a pain to keep clean. I saw online that it was possible to replace the steam wand on a Gaggia Classic with one from a Rancilio Silvia so I took the chance and purchased a Rancilio Sivlia steam wand for $15 from eBay. What follows are the general instructions necessary to make this swap work on a Gaggia New Baby.

First, remove the water tank and disconnect the power. Then remove the two screws from the back side. The are located underneath where the water tank was located on the black plastic.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1092"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2608-e1427744095108-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2608"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next pull the steam control knob straight up to remove it and remove the screw at the top of the machine.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1093"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2609-e1427744195662-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2609"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next lay the machine on its back with the bottom facing up. There are 2 screws underneath, next to the group head.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1091"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2607-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2607"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Next stand the machine upright and slowly pull the black cover straight up to remove it from the rest of the machine. There is enough slack in the wiring harness which allowed me to keep everything connect, I just laid it aside. You'll see where the hose connecting to the steam wand is located and there is a small plate with 2 screws. Remove the screws and slide the plate up. The factory wand will pull up through the housing.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1087"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2598-225x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2598"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

The next part is probably the hardest step, but that isn't saying much. There is a plastic clip securing the wand to the round ball and the hose. I found the easiest way to do this was the secure the wand in my left and use my thumb and forefinger to put upward pressure on the ball. Then take a small flat head screwdriver and use it to push the 3 clips inside the ball toward the center. Keeping the upward pressure will hold them as work you way around to all 3 clips inside. I've tried to capture this as best as possible but it was hard to get a good shot.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1088"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2600-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2600"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

With the clip removed slide it down the factory wand and pull out the factory wand.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1089"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2602-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2602"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

I saw on some videos that the Rancilio Silivia wand had a flared end that sometimes had to be ""flattened"" in order to remove the large factory nut. Mine was not flared and the nut and washed easily slid off when I unscrewed the nozzle. I just put the plastic clip onto the Rancilio wand and pushed it back into the ball.

<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1090"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2603-300x300.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2603"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Re-assemble in opposite order. Secure the cover on the steam wand, put the case back on. 2 screws underneath next to the group head, one under the steam control knob, finally the last 2 on the black plastic underneath where the water tank sits. Then just screw the nozzle back onto the Rancilio wand, and give her a spin.

3/26/2015 15:33,Perl Beginnings,"After reading some advice from some very smart people, I've decided to try my hand at learning a scripting language to aid in my network administration tasks. After some quick searching I've decided to learn Perl. From what I've gathered it has strong text manipulation capabilities which will come in handy parsing device configs or SNMP/SSH responses. I'm not going to attempt to teach programming basics, but what I hope to cover will be some useful examples and building blocks that we can use as network administrators.

For my scripting setup I will be focusing on a Windows perspective. Instead of using <a href=""http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads"" target=""_blank"">ActivePerl</a> I decided to use <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cygwin</a> and the Perl modules, so hopefully most of what I write will also apply to *nix users. I'm also using <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a> for my editing/coding, but you could also use the default Windows Notepad or if you want to be hardcore, Cygwin and VIM. I may include some VIM tips/shortcuts in future posts.

My first Perl script is not ""Hello, World"", but instead a simple Ping script. I used <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/Net/Ping.html"" target=""_blank"">Net::Ping</a> to conduct a simple ICMP Ping and then output the results. The example I first used had a hard-coded variable for the host, which I left commented out for reference purposes. Instead, I added a line to receive a command line argument for the host variable.
<pre>use Net::Ping;
use strict;

#Setting a variable
#my $host = ""www.google.com"";

#Using an arguement
my $host = ""$ARGV[$0]"";
my $pingobj = Net::Ping-&gt;new('icmp');
my ($status,$time,$ip) = $pingobj-&gt;ping($host);

if ($status) {
print ""Host $host ($ip) responded in $time secondsn"";
} else {
print ""Host $host ($ip) unreachablen"";
}
</pre>
Voila!

I plan on using this script as a building block to test connectivity before performing more complex tasks in the future. Hopefully this will motivate somebody to get their hands dirty and add another tool to their skill set.",,

2/9/2015 14:10,Quality of Service,"Our networks are basically application delivery platforms, or service delivery platforms, that service could be a website, a database, or a phone call. Quality of Service isn't necessarily a thing, or protocol by itself. Instead QoS is more of a group of ideas, technologies, or architecture which when individually implemented can help to improve or guantee the quality of a service which the nework is delivering.

The whole reason for QoS goes back to bandwidth and the networking basic of TDM vs packet-switched networks. Within a TDM network, an individual circuit has guaranteed bandwidth. While on a packet-switched network different traffic is switched across shared circuits. A prime example?ÿis PRI vs SIP. A PRI T1 has 23 dedicated B Channels which can be used for individual calls while a SIP trunk using G.711 codec would use 85kbps per call. Notice that the SIP trunk doesn't have dedicated channels for each call, only that each call consumes a certain amount of bandwidth. The limitation of course being the network bandwidth, which is where QoS features come into play.",,

How much startup capital do I need, and once I get it, will the business be profitable? I wanted to know what my startup costs and my operating costs would be first. I tried to think of as much as I could?ÿabout what my monthly recurring costs would be. I called a few lessors and real estate brokers to find out rent. I started calculating employee compensation costs, and other items that we would need each month. I then wanted to know my startup costs, I made a list of as much equipment as I could think of we would need to open and began pricing that equipment. I even talked to contractors and got quotes on buildout expenses. While this was a good first shot, I overlooked a few major expenses which made opening more stressful than it should have been.

The first thing I looked at before I opened our shop was feasibility. I wanted to make sure that the business could actually survive and make money before I wasted too much time pursuing the idea. I made a spreadsheet to caclulate employee costs, both base pay and payroll taxes. I had to pick a set of hours and schedule to calculate off, but once it was plugged into the spreadsheet it was easy to expirement with the numbers. Adding in estimated rent, and a few other monthly expenses, I finally came to an estimated monthly recurring cost I could use to test feasibility. Beyond MRC, I also had to consider Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). While mine was coffee shop specific, these numbers can usually be found online, either through people sharing or industry averages. The final part was the one that kept me up at night for quite a while. Will they come? I found a location we wanted to rent, which luckily had a recent traffic report. What percentage of people driving by would stop by for a cup of coffee??ÿWe also looked at city population and average household income.?ÿSo based on a guestimated daily traffic count, as well as an industry average for average ticket sale I could calculate whether or not we could afford our MRC and still make a profit. I tried to plan ultra-conservatively, and I'm still questioning myself, ""Will they come?""

After I knew that this could be a sustainable business, I wanted to know what it would take to get it started. I priced equipment, buildout costs, initial inventory, electronics, and the list goes on. AND I STILL MISSED THINGS!! Maybe once everything is complete I'll write another post about our total opening expenses. I tried to envision first as an employee what it would take to make everything on the menu, from the refrigerator to the stirring sticks.

I did not anticipate the need to pay for fees such as security deposits or even some loan payments. This might be obvious to others, but it was just something that I overlooked, that made things a little tighter than I would have liked.

9/3/2014 12:29,Cleaning Things Up,"This has been something I've been trying to do for quite a while. I have my registered domain name that I use for my personal blog, which originally started as a primarily networking (IT related) blog. I wouldn't consider it popular by any means, yet it does get some traffic. So when I would write a non-networking related post, it felt quite out of place. I went back and forth on whether or not to break these out into separate sites, but I always felt like I wanted to keep them under my ""umbrella"".

What this boils down to is that I am a real live person (a single entity), and my domain name is reflective of that. However, I have multiple roles, I'm a husband, a father, I have a job (""professional"" is debatable), I have other business ventures, hobbies, etc. I've wanted to separate these things because I don't think that people reading about my coffee shop ventures are interested in the latest technology Cisco has to offer. I used Wordpress.org as the platform for this site and I debated between separate sites (installs), Wordpress MultiSite, and just using plain categories. I like and have used the categories, but I still felt like it wasn't separated enough for my tastes and I didn't like the robertjuric.com/category/whatever URL format. Then I ready an article about custom post types, and I was enlightened.

Custom post types are a way to customize Wordpress into doing things it was never conceived to do. I've seen them used in Wordpress plugins so instead of just posts and pages, you can have custom types for instance called books, players, teams, events, etc. What I like about this is the shortened URL (robertjuric.com/networking/) as well as the separate management of the different posts types. The All Posts menu only shows my normal ""posts"" I have a separate menu for ""networking"" and ""code"".
<h3>How I'm Doing It</h3>
Plugins, Home Page, Firehose

Creating custom post types is done in code, and can be done with a very quick and simple custom plugin. I decided to look around and settled on the existing <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/types/"" target=""_blank"">Types plugin</a>. It was very simple to install and then I just?ÿadded Custom Post Types for each of my desired categories. One thing I noticed was the whole singular/plural thing. Since networking isn't really a noun it was hard to pluralize, so what I did was add 'post' to the name, but I left the slug what I desired the URL to be. For instance, my networking Custom Post Type is?ÿcalled ""Network Post"", ""Network Posts"", and ""networking"" is the slug. Then I would check all of the 'Display Sections' so that I could turn off comments, or set a featured image.

That was great, now I have a custom spot on my single blog/domain name to separate my different roles. But I've had this blog for a few years now, how do I pull all of my old 'posts' into the new custom post types I've created? Enter the fairly obvious plugin?ÿ<a href=""http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/"" target=""_blank"">Post Type Switcher</a>. This plugin adds a setting to the Edit and Quick Edit screens to configure which post type the post belongs to. What I did, since I already had my different posts assigned to different categories, was view all the posts in a category and bulk edit them to change the post type.

The next thing I had to do update my themes functions.php to show the custom post types on the home page. If you really wanted to keep things separate you could skip this step, and I'm probably going roll this back on my current home page as I get more generic content added to my primary blog. All you have to do is add this code to your themes function.php file. Just replace the ""slug#"" with the slugs you configured on your custom post types.

<code>// Added for custom post types, Show posts of 'post', 'slug1' and 'slug2' post types on home page
add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'add_my_post_types_to_query' );
function add_my_post_types_to_query( $query ) {
if ( is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() )
$query-&gt;set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'slug1', 'slug2', 'slug3' ) );
return $query;
}</code>
<h3>Menu and?ÿRSS Feeds</h3>
The next thing I wanted to do was make it easier for any readers I had left with an easy way to select which content that they wanted to view. What I have done is created a widget with simple URLs to the RSS feeds for each of my custom post types. This was quite easy to do by creating links to the feeds with this URL format: <code>http://example.com/feed/?post_type[]=slug1</code>

To get the menu items to appear I had to create custom URL menu items with links to the slugs (robertjuric.com/slug1).
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
If you get creative you can really do some cool things with Wordpress and Custom Post Types. Well this was meant to be a quick introduction to Custom Post Types and I hope it served that purpose. It also is the final nail in the coffin of my different roles/sites. So if you're one of my fellow network geeks, update your RSS feeds so you stay up to date with my mediocre technical blogging.",,

What this boils down to is that I am a real live person, and my domain name is reflective of that. However, I have multiple roles, I'm a husband, a father, I have a job (""professional"" is debatable), I have other business ventures, hobbies, etc. I've wanted to separate these things because I don't think that people reading about my coffee shop ventures are interested in the latest technology Cisco has to offer. I used Wordpress.org as the platform for this site and I debated between separate sites, Wordpress MultiSite, and just using plain categories. I liked the categories, but I still felt like it wasn't separated enough for my tastes and I didn't like the robertjuric.com/category/whatever URL format. Then I ready an article about custom post types, and I was enlightened.

Custom post types are a way to customize Wordpress into doing things it was never conceived to do. I've seen them used in Wordpress plugins so instead of just posts and pages, you can have custom types for instance called books, players, teams, events, etc. What I like about this is the shortened URL (robertjuric.com/networking/) as well as the separate management of the different posts types. The All Posts menu only shows my normal ""posts"" I have a separate menu for ""networking"" and ""code"".
<h3>How I'm Doing It</h3>
Plugins, Home Page, Firehose

Creating custom post types is done in code, and is can be done with a very quick and simple custom plugin. I decided to look around and settled on the existing <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/types/"" target=""_blank"">Types plugin</a>. It was very simple to install and then I just?ÿadded Custom Post Types for each of my desired categories. One thing I noticed was the whole singular/plural thing. Since networking isn't really a noun it was hard to pluralize, so what I did was add 'post' to the name, but I left the slug what I desired the URL to be. For instance, my networking related posts are called ""Network Post"", ""Network Posts"", and ""networking"". Then I would check all of the 'Display Sections' so that I could turn off comments, or set a featured image.

That was great, now I have a custom spot on my single blog/domain name to separate my different roles. But I've had this blog for a few years now, how do I pull all of my old 'posts' into the new custom post types I've created? Enter the fairly obvious plugin?ÿ<a href=""http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/"" target=""_blank"">Post Type Switcher</a>. This plugin adds a setting to the Edit and Quick Edit screens to configure which post type the post belongs to. What I did, since I already had my different posts assigned to different categories was view all the posts in a category and bulk edit them to change the post type.

The next thing I had to do update my themes functions.php to show the custom post types on the home page. If you really wanted to keep things separate you could skip this step, and I'm probably going roll this back on my current home page as I get more generic content added to my primary blog. All you have to do is add this code to your themes function.php file. Just replace the ""slug#"" with the slugs you configured on your custom post types.

<code>// Added for custom post types, Show posts of 'post', 'page' and 'movie' post types on home page

add_action( 'pre_get_posts', 'add_my_post_types_to_query' );

function add_my_post_types_to_query( $query ) {
if ( is_home() &amp;&amp; $query-&gt;is_main_query() )
$query-&gt;set( 'post_type', array( 'post', 'smalltowncoffee', 'networking', 'code' ) );
return $query;
}</code>

9/2/2014 11:31,"Link Aggregation Showdown - Juniper, Cisco, VMware","A friend and I got into a discussion regarding supported link aggregation methods between VMware and various networking vendors. As I was trying to inform him of the differences, I was sure to do my research and I thought I would share.

He was using Cisco switches and wanted to run LACP because he thought that Cisco's Etherchannel did not have any negotiation protocol unless you used LACP. He then thought that VMware would support LACP, since it was an open standard after-all. We have both been bitten by misconfigured link aggregations when connecting to VMware. It turns out he was wrong here on both fronts. First of all, VMware only supports static configuration for link aggregation (NIC teaming as they call it.) Secondly, Cisco's Etherchannel does support negotiation using PAgP(Cisco Proprietary), if configured to do so. I just wanted to point this out for future reference. So I put together a quick cheat sheet for him to use building link aggregation bundles across vendors.

Static Link Aggregation:
VMware - Configure the port group NIC teaming to ""Route Based on IP Hash""
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode on</pre>
Juniper - <pre>set interface &lt;name&gt; ether-options 802.3ad ae#</pre>

Link Aggregation Negotiation (LACP):
VMware - Not Supported
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode active</pre>
Juniper - The Static Configuration + <pre>set interface ae# aggregated-ether-options lacp active</pre>

Link Aggregation Negotiation (PAgP):
VMware - Not Supported
Cisco - <pre>port-channel # mode desirable</pre>
Juniper - Not Supported

There are also passive configuration options for both LACP  and PAgP, however I prefer to always statically define my port roles. These are also not complete configs for either Cisco or Juniper, I merely wanted to point out the differences in the commands between the different vendors.",,
9/2/2014 11:31,JUNOS - Destination NAT as Port Forwarding,"I recently moved into a new house and a new cable Internet provider. I decided I'd take the opportunity to upgrade my home network and implement a Juniper SRX100 (I &lt;3 JUNOS) as my Internet router/firewall.
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0963.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-420"" title=""HomeNetwork"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_0963.jpg?w=300"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""450"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The initial setup of the SRX100 was surprisingly pain-free. I had to reset it to factory defaults after I had been using it for some labbing, and the factory default config worked pretty much out of the box. I run a few private servers at my house and needed to setup some port forwarding as I only have a single public IP address. You can easily accomplish this with JUNOS Destination NAT, and I would like to share with you some interesting quirks I found in its implementation.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Destination NAT works by specifying NAT rules based upon a packet's destination address (and port). By configuring NAT rules based on the destination address of your public IP address you're able to to redirect a certain address or port to a private internal address of your choosing. In the case of the standard home user you would specify rules for different ports destined (incoming) to your single public IP address to be translated to multiple private addresses (one-to-many NAT). If you had multiple public IP addresses you could configure the different address to be redirected to multiple private addresses (many-to-many NAT).</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Configuration of Destination NAT is also relatively simple; it only requires a destination pool for your internal server(s), NAT rules, and a security policy to allow traffic to flow between the zones.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">I first configured a single pool for my internal server's IP address:</p>

<pre>set security nat destination pool &lt;pool_name&gt; address 192.168.1.5/32</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Next I began to configure NAT rules for each port I wanted to forward. This is also where it got interesting. The syntax for creating NAT rules is:</p>

<pre>set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; from zone untrust
set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; rule &lt;rule_name&gt; match destination-address 0.0.0.0/0
set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; rule &lt;rule_name&gt; match destination-port &lt;#&gt;
set security nat destination rule-set &lt;rule_set_name&gt; rule &lt;rule_name&gt; then destination-nat pool &lt;pool_name&gt;
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">To keep things straightforward I named my rule-set ""untrust-to-trust"" and the rule names to match the port number (i.e. Port1024). Setting the destination-address to 0/0 is not in the documentation, but it will work if you rely on a dynamically assigned public IP address like I do. Another issue I ran into was a limitation on the number of rules allowed in a rule-set. Any JUNOS code version before 10.1R1 has a limitation of 8 rules per rule-set.?ÿ You can see how this could become a problem if you're attempting to forward a range of IP addresses. A code upgrade resolved this problem for me and extended the limitation to 512 rules per rule-set. Unfortunately there is no way to configure destination NAT for a range of ports, each rule is limited to a single port definition.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The final step requires configuring a security policy and address book entry to allow traffic to cross zones:</p>

<pre>set security zones security-zone trust address-book address &lt;address_name&gt; 192.168.1.5/32
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match source-address any
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match destination-address &lt;address_name&gt;
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; match application any
set security policies from-zone untrust to-zone trust policy &lt;policy_name&gt; then permit
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">You can obviously keep your security tighter by specifying an application instead of using 'application any'.?ÿ The NAT is applied before the security policies are checked which is why the NAT rule's destination address is your public IP address and the security policy's destination address is the private internal IP address.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">By using Destination NAT in JUNOS?ÿ you can effectively implement port forwarding for your home network. I'm satisfied with my SRX as a home router/firewall and enjoy the flexibility it brings.</p>",,

9/2/2014 11:26,Cisco AAA,"Controlling who can play with you networking equipment is somewhat important. If you run the kind of network where you don't care who can log in and lab on your gear then you can probably skip this post. But for the rest of us, I'm going to cover Cisco's AAA features and what good they are to us as network engineers/admins. 

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, and is most commonly used to control administrative access to our boxes. Authentication is all about identity; can you who you are by providing the correct password? Authorization is kind of like the hall pass; I know you're allowed in this building, but are you allowed down this hall? And finally Accounting is big brother's spy eye, keeping track of what you're doing and how long you spent doing it. 

Now AAA isn't just used to control admin access, it actually can operate in two types or modes. The first mode is <strong>Character</strong> mode and is used to control remote admin access for line(vty, console) or EXEC mode commands. The other mode is <strong>Packet</strong> mode and is used to control remote network access for things such as VPN or PPP users. AAA can also either local(internal) or external services. Local or internal services use an internal database, while the external service can use either Cisco ACS and TACACS+ or another type of control server using RADIUS. Because AAA and TACACS+ are Cisco systems/protocols they obviously offer more robustness over the standard RADIUS implementations. Most notably, TACACS+ separates all 3 functions of AAA to allow for more granularity while RADIUS combines Authentication and Authorization. Also, TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet body, while RADIUS only encrypts the password attribute portion of a Access-Request packet.

Configuration of AAA is fairly straight forward. You have to enable AAA with the <strong>aaa new-model</strong> global config command, and then specify your TACACS+ servers using the <strong>tacacs-server host &lt;ip&gt; key &lt;password&gt;</strong> global config command. From there you can then enable each facet of AAA as desired. 

To configure login authentication to use all configured TACACS+ servers with a local database as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local</strong>
To configure enable accounting to use all configured TACACS+ servers with the configured enable secret as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable</strong>

I would go into a little detail regarding authorization, but unless you have a teams that are only allowed to issue certain commands, such as a NOC only being allowed to configure or reset certain settings, then I feel that authorization is useless. You can Google to the Cisco docs if you think you really need this feature.

To configure accounting of sessions and commands entered to a TACACS+ server, use the commands:
<strong>aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 0 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
(We don't use any any privilege levels other than 0 or 15, but if you wish you can specify any value from 0-15).

So there you have a high-level overview of Cisco's AAA features. There is a lot of granularity in the options and I strongly suggest you read the documentation if you're looking for a specific feature or option. I mean, it's not really a blog post if I just re-write Cisco's docs on AAA. ",,

9/2/2014 11:26,Bits on a Wire,"Bits, Frames, Packets, Streams, Datagrams; we have many terms for what basically involves getting information sent across a transmission medium. However, I like details, and I think that the terms should be used correctly. As somebody once told me, ""Words have meanings!"" So let's get a few things straight:

<strong>Bits</strong> - The last logical unit of data before the information is turned into an electrical or optical signal.

<strong>Frames</strong> - Layer 2 data units used to transfer data between adjacent network nodes. Provides frame synchronization (framing) and can provide error detection.

<strong>Packets</strong> - Used to establish the path which data travels from host-to-host. In the world of networking and the OSI model, this strictly refers to Layer 3 (IPv4 or IPv6).

Let's pause right here to make a special note between frames and packets and their uses. Frames are used at L2 to transfer data between adjacent nodes, while packets are used at L3 to transfer data between end-to-end hosts. What this means is that L2 frame headers(src/dst addresses) are rewritten at each node while L3 packet headers (src/dst addresses) do not change.

<strong>Segments/Streams/Datagrams</strong> - Used by Layer 4 protocols to provide end to end communication for applications. Datagram is a term used when delivery, time, or order are not guaranteed by the protocol, such as with UDP. Streams/segments are used by protocols such as TCP to guarantee end to end error free communication. A TCP stream is considered a data stream of bytes, not individual messages. If this single flow of bytes is too large to flow across the network in a single message, it can be fragmented into smaller pieces. A TCP segment would be an individual piece of the larger TCP stream. TCP streams offer many ""services"" for applications such as ordered delivery, guaranteed delivery, flow control, congestion avoidance, and even multiplexing.

As network engineers it's our job to ensure that end to end communication is available for the higher layers of our protocol stacks. Now that we know the correct terms for how data is encapsulated so that it can be transported across the network we should start to look at how this data fits across our network. How big are these TCP segments, datagrams, packets and frames flowing across our network? At first it may look like this doesn't matter but when a higher level protocol is trying to cram too much information into the pipes this can cause problems. Just picture connecting a garden hose to a fire hydrant. This is where MTU and MSS come into play.

MTU, Maximum Transmission Unit, is the maximum size of data that a network layer can forward. This means that MTU is/can be different for each layer (Ethernet MTU, IPv4 MTU). TCP uses MSS, Maximum Segment Size, to define the maximum size of data that it will include in an individual TCP segment which would make up a TCP stream. We will talk about MSS in a moment, for now let's focus on MTU.

Differentiating between the physical interface MTU (PHY MTU) and IP MTU can get a little confusing. The PHY MTU is the maximum allowed frame size (not counting the header) or in other words, the payload size. IP MTU is the maximum packet size allowed to transmit before fragmentation occurs. Increasing PHY MTU will also increase IP MTU. However decreasing IP MTU will not affect the interface PHY MTU. Why does this matter? In scenarios where we are adding additional headers such as GRE or MPLS. To accommodate the extra protocol overheard of something like GRE, you could lower the IP MTU by 24 bytes to leave room for the GRE overhead without exceeding the PHY MTU.

TCP MSS is the maximum size of data that TCP is willing to <strong>RECEIVE</strong> in a segment. When a TCP connection is established between two hosts they announce their TCP MSS to each other. It's interesting to note that TCP MSS isn't negotiated and doesn't necessarily have to match.

5/9/2014 11:45,TCP 3-Way Handshake,"Dude 1: Hey, can we talk?
Dude 2: Yea, we can talk.
Dude 1: Cool.
<blockquote>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.
-Albert Einstein</blockquote>
But in all technical seriousness, let's talk?ÿabout TCP. I think it's important for network engineers to understand TCP because it is one of the 2 protocols used for transport by higher level protocols such as HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc. Understanding that transport protocol can help when supporting other teams in your environment. Sometimes saying, ""well I can ping the server, it's not a network problem"" doesn't cut it, and that just encourages finger pointing. So after we have verified Layer 3 connectivity, we can start looking at troubleshooting Layer 4. This is usually best done with a packet capture, and where a good understanding of TCP can help.

If we break down troubleshooting Layer 4, and specifically TCP, the first thing that we need to verify is whether or not TCP is establishing 2-way communication between the end-hosts. TCP uses the famous 3-way handshake to establish this communication.

<code>SYN
SYN-ACK
ACK</code>

At the end of a successful handshake, a socket has been created and is used to transmit data. If there is a problem completing the handshake then the 2-way communication needs to be verified. TCP uses a similar, but 4-way, handshake to tear-down connections once the data transmission is complete:

Dude 1: Hey, I've got to run.
Dude 2: Ok, that's cool.
Dude 2: I'll see you later.
Dude 1: Bye.

We have a 4-way because both ends have to request (<code>FIN-ACK</code>) and agree (<code>ACK</code>) to tear down the connection. There are ways to cheat and end the connection sooner using <code>RST</code> flags, but that's not always ideal. So that's just a little about starting and tearing down TCP sessions, which can be helpful in troubleshooting TCP connectivity between end-hosts. In a future post I plan on writing a little more on the other TCP flags and maybe a post about performance issues.",,

3/24/2014 9:13,Things That Make My Life Easier,"As network engineers we live busy lives. We usually have multiple things happening and we have to remain agile to keep up with our daily work. I've slowly built a personal system which I use to help me stay on top of my mounting workload.
<h2>Notes</h2>
<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-873"" alt=""The Post-It System"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-300x225.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

Some people rely on the post-it note system. For me, this doesn't cut it. I am constantly juggling multiple projects and tasks, many of which are hurry up and wait scenarios. I work on a project and then have to be able to come back to it and pick back up where I left off. Or sometimes I need save a config snippet I did, or templates I've used to deploy port configurations. Which brings me to one of my favorite (yet anti-climatic) tools, <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a>.
<h2>Notepad++</h2>
I use Notepad++ for multiple reasons, one of the biggest is tabs. I have created a folder (obviously called Notes), which I save all of my information to. When I get a call, or start to work a ticket, I immediately open a new tab (Ctrl+N) and start to work. When I'm done I can look at it and either close the tab without saving, or save it to my Notes folder. I like having multiple tabs open because I reference some things multiple times a day and it makes it much easier than constantly browsing for a file.

The next big reason I use Notepad++ is for the column editing mode. Instead of deleting or inserting at the beginning of each line 10 times, you can use Column Editing mode to do it all at once. To do this just Alt+Click in the document. This feature along with search and replace makes it easy to take the output from a show command, modify it with search+replace, and turn it into a script to paste back into the device.

There is also a handy <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-compare/"" target=""_blank"">Compare Plugin for Notepad++</a> that can be useful for comparing config changes.
<h2>CLI</h2>
<a href=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Matrix-in-CMD.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-877"" alt=""Matrix Code"" src=""http://robertjuric.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Matrix-in-CMD-300x225.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

As network engineers we spend most of our time at the Command Line Interface. This involves a lot of time spent with terminal emulation programs. I like <a href=""http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"" target=""_blank"">PuTTY</a> and it's great in a pinch, but if you work in a large environment I strongly suggest you check out <a href=""http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/"" target=""_blank"">SecureCRT</a>. It is pricey ($100 for 1yr of updates), but I feel it is an investment well worth it. Well managed tabs and organized saved sessions are absolute life-savers.

One of the biggest things I've learned to do with SecureCRT is setup auto-logging. To do this you have to edit the session options and you can specify the log file name and how you want to save your logs using convenient variables. I do this in-case I fat-finger a command and generally having logs is always a good thing. It's also an easy way to capture the crazy output that is ""show tech"" for TAC cases.
<h2>Task Management</h2>
The final tool I'm going to mention is a webapp I use to manage my project tasks. There are plenty of apps out there. The one I've settled on using is <a href=""https://www.nirvanahq.com/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>. It is a Getting Things Done (GTD) based web app and also has an iOS client. I like it primarily because I can group my tasks into projects. Being GTD based, it has a folder/view for Next items (stuff I need to be doing now) and Project folders/views (for stuff that isn't immediate). I also like that it has Contexts and areas to filter your tasks (great for separating home and work tasks and projects).
<h2>The Take-Away</h2>
Build yourself a system. I'm sure you have plenty of issues, methods, and opinions that make every situation unique. These are the tools I've discovered that best suite me, but there are plenty more out there. Don't settle for mediocrity when it comes to tools you use on a daily basis, craftsmen don't and you shouldn't either.",,
3/24/2014 9:10,Goals,"I used to have a goal in life. Not that I don't have goals anymore, but in this case, I am referring to a specific goal. I had an goal of a job/career that I wanted to do. And lately in my life I've become frustrated because I felt like I've been straying away from this goal, this end-state that I desired. I wanted to be a fancy, big-shot, network engineer. I wanted to work for a big company, maybe do a little traveling, and generally be somebody important. 

But what I've started to realize as I've come a few steps closer to that goal was that I didn't like the life that surrounded it. I'm not comfortable with a lot of travel, I'm not willing to relocate, and I don't like the idea of the long hours it would take to reach that goal. And that was making me mad. I was mad and upset because I wasn't reaching my goal, even though I didn't like the life it required. This has really been bothering me for some time. I was wanting to do X, but felt stuck doing Y, and I was frustrated.

But I just read <a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/11/04/hunter-s-thomspon-letters-of-note-advice/"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>. And it struck me that what I've been doing is actually a much better thing. That article discusses a letter Hunter S. Thompson wrote regarding how to find meaning in your life. And what the author,  Maria Popova, discusses in that article and Thompson's letter is the subject of fixed goals. You set a fixed goal in life, yet you are not in a fixed position in life; your perspective is constantly changing. When you focus on a fixed goal such as a career, you are going to be forced to mold yourself around that goal, changing who you are to achieve that fixed target. 

Hunter S. Thompson purposes that it is much better to focus on being yourself. Focus on the life you want to live, and pick goals that are aligned with that life. I'm not saying that changing yourself to reach a goal is a bad thing. Without that change, we would have no self improvement. What I am saying is do not try to force yourself into a mold just because it looks cool, or it's what everyone says you should do. Focus on the life you want, pick goals in line with that, and you will be much happier. For me, I don't want to relocate to a big city, I don't want to travel (a lot), I want flexibility to maintain a healthy work-life balance, I want to serve my Church and spend time with my family. If that means I can't have that fancy job, so be it. I don't want the life that goes with that decision. I'll pick a new goal, aligned with the life I want.",,
3/24/2014 9:08,Git Lessons Learned,"Wow, Git can get out of hand quickly. I thought I'd share some of my lessons learned from actually using Git since my last <a href=""http://robertjuric.com/2014/03/17/using-github/"" target=""_blank"">Using GitHub post</a>.

<strong>Do no track large files, such as /data/</strong>
My app started out simple enough, but then I installed MongoDB, and maybe through sheer ignorance I decided to install the data folder in the same folder as my repository. Well I added the folder to the repository and committed. When I tried to push I found out there is a file size limit. Live and learn.

<strong>Can use exlude file to ignore those folders, or place data in other folder</strong>
So I'm not sure if you're supposed to include the node modules in the repository or not, but to avoid the non-tracking errors you can just stop tracking them in the exclude file.

<strong>Use 'git status' to make sure no local commits haven't been pushed</strong>
After I committed my too large data/ folder, I tried to push to the remote repo. I didn't noticed that it failed. I continued making commits until I caught my error 4 commits in. If I had checked the git status I could have caught the error and resolved it much easier than being 4 commits in.

<strong>Conflicts suck, commit and push regularly, check status often</strong>
Biggest lesson learned right here. Resolving conflicts or correcting a mistake is a huge headache, one best just avoided. Commit often, push after commits, and check status to verify.

<strong>CLI &gt; GUI</strong>
This one is probably obvious to most, but since I come from a Windows background I started out trying to use the GUI. Luckily I'm a network engineer by day and I feel at home on the CLI. It doesn't take long to learn the CLI syntax and then you have much better control of Git.

Here are some of the Git commands I use quite often. This may well just be a future reference for myself:
<code>//Remove file from tracking but keep actual file
git rm --cached file.txt</code>

<code>//Create branch
git checkout -b Branch-Name</code>

<strong>Do no track large files, such as /data/</strong>
My app started out simple enough, but then I installed MongoDB, and maybe through sheer ignorance I decided to install the data folder in the same folder as my repository. Well I added the folder to the repository and committed. When I tried to push I found out there is a file size limit. Live and learn.

<strong>Can use exlude file to ignore those folders, or place data in other folder</strong>
So I'm not sure if you're supposed to include the node modules in the repository or not, but to avoid the non-tracking errors you can just stop tracking them in the exclude file.

<strong>Use 'git status' to make sure no local commits haven't been pushed</strong>
After I committed my too large data/ folder, I tried to push to the remote repo. I didn't noticed that it failed. I continued making commits until I caught my error 4 commits in. If I had checked the git status I could have caught the error and resolved it much easier than being 4 commits in.

<strong>Conflicts suck, commit and push regularly, check status often</strong>
Biggest lesson learned right here. Resolving conflicts or correcting a mistake is a huge headache, one best just avoided. Commit often, push after commits, and check status to verify.

<strong>CLI &gt; GUI</strong>
This one is probably obvious to most, but since I come from a Windows background I started out trying to use the GUI. Luckily I'm a network engineer by day and I feel at home on the CLI. It doesn't take long to learn the CLI syntax and then you have much better control of Git.

Here are some of the Git commands I use quite often. This may well just be a future reference for myself:
<code>//Remove file from tracking but keep actual file
git rm --cached file.txt</code>

<code>//Create branch
git checkout -b Branch-Name</code>

<code>//Commit, force add files, comment
git commit -a -m 'Commit comment'</code>

<code>//Push to remote branch
git push origin Branch-Name</code>

Branches are also important, because the master branch is supposed to be your deployable code. If you are going to work on a new feature, you should create a branch to work on that feature, commit changes to it, and then if it tests out ok, merge the branch back with the primary.

12/21/2013 6:37,Redistribute Connected,"I've been building a lab scenario out for my next Pluralsight course and I discovered some interesting (or at least new to me) behavior with Cisco OSPF. I've already known about the different OSPF router types (ABR, ASBR), but it never really clicked for me until I saw it in real life.

The lab setup is very simple, a Juniper EX4200 connected to two Cisco 1721s running OSPF. Since I'm doing the labs on the Juniper EX4200, I was going to preconfigure the Cisco routers to already have OSPF configured. I configured the L3 interfaces and a network statement for the physical and the RID loopback. I also configured a loopback interface so I could generate some extra routes to the Juniper. I thought I would keep things simple so I just added the 'redistribute connected' command under the OSPF configuration without adding additional network statements. (This is me being lazy.)

When I logged into the EX4200 to verify the routes were working I noticed that one of the loopback routes I configured was showing up as an OSPF external route [OSPF/150]:
<code>192.168.10.1/32 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:17, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.2.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
192.168.50.0/24 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:12, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.3.2 via ge-0/0/23.0
</code>

So I started digging into the Cisco router to see why it was displaying the RID loopback, which had a network statement as an OSPF internal route, and the one being redistributed was showing up as external. A quick show ip ospf command and I had my lightbulb moment:
<code>Cisco-RTR#sh ip ospf 1
Routing Process ""ospf 1"" with ID 2.2.2.2
Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes
Supports opaque LSA
Supports Link-local Signaling (LLS)
Supports area transit capability
<strong> It is an autonomous system boundary router
Redistributing External Routes from,
connected</strong>
Initial SPF schedule delay 5000 msecs</code>

That's when it hit me that the redistributed routes were automatically advertised as external. Which when I started thinking it made perfect sense. If we think about what the OSPF 'network' statement is actually doing; which is enabling OSPF and adding the interface(s) to the topology. Then it makes sense that my redistributed loopback interface wasn't actually part of the OSPF topology, it was just a network being advertised into the topology. I guess I was just thinking that since it was still a local interface on a router running OSPF that it wouldn't be considered 'external'. That's what I get for thinking. <strong>The ASBR function is to redistribute routes from other protocols, even if that protocol is directly connected.</strong>

When I was doing research into this behavior I found <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094707.shtml"" target=""_blank"">this Cisco link</a>. So, I added a network statement to cover my additional loopback interface. This corrected the route preference on the Juniper EX4200, but I noticed that the Cisco router still considered itself an ASBR. So even if you have network statements covering all of the interfaces on the router, if 'redistribute connected' is still configured then the router will act as an ASBR.

This might be a 'duh' moment for most other engineers, and when I look back, it is. But it was a lightbulb moment for me to really understand the Type 5 LSA and the function of the ASBR in OSPF.",,

<code>192.168.10.1/32 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:17, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.2.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
192.168.50.0/24 *[OSPF/150] 00:00:12, metric 20, tag 0
&gt; to 10.10.3.2 via ge-0/0/23.0
</code>

So I started digging into the Cisco router to see why it was displaying the RID loopback, which had a network statement as an OSPF internal route, and the one being redistributed was showing up as external. A quick show ip ospf command and I had my lightbulb moment:
<code>Cisco-RTR#sh ip ospf 1
Routing Process ""ospf 1"" with ID 2.2.2.2
Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes
Supports opaque LSA
Supports Link-local Signaling (LLS)
Supports area transit capability
<strong> It is an autonomous system boundary router
Redistributing External Routes from,
connected</strong>
Initial SPF schedule delay 5000 msecs</code>

That's when it hit me that the redistributed routes were automatically advertised as external. Which when I started thinking it made perfect sense. If we think about what the OSPF 'network' statement is actually doing; which is enabling OSPF and adding the interface(s) to the topology. Then it makes sense that my redistributed loopback interface wasn't actually part of the OSPF topology, it was just a network being advertised into the topology. I guess I was just thinking that since it was still a local interface on a router running OSPF that it wouldn't be considered 'external'. That's what I get for thinking. <strong>The ASBR function is to redistribute routes from other protocols, even if that protocol is directly connected.</strong>

When I was doing research into this behavior I found <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094707.shtml"" target=""_blank"">this Cisco link</a>. So, I added a network statement to cover my additional loopback interface. This corrected the route preference on the Juniper EX4200, but I noticed that the Cisco router still considered itself an ASBR. So even if you have network statements covering all of the interfaces on the router, if 'redistribute connected' is still configured the router will act as an ASBR.

This might be a 'duh' moment for most other engineers, and when I look back, it is. But it was a lightbulb moment for me to really understand the Type 5 LSA and the function of the ASBR in OSPF.",,

I've already known about the different OSPF router types (ABR, ASBR), but it never really clicked for me until I saw it in real life.

The lab setup is very simple, a Juniper EX4200 connected to two Cisco 1721s running OSPF. Since I'm doing the labs on the Juniper EX4200, I was going to preconfigure the Cisco routers to already have OSPF configured. I configured the L3 interfaces and a network statement for the physical and the RID loopback. I also configured a loopback interface so I could generate some extra routes to the Juniper. I thought I would keep things simple so I just added the 'redistribute connected' command under the OSPF configuration without adding additional network statements.

I use this study sheet to look at the day of the exam and right before I walk into the testing center. These aren't complete notes, they're only a summary that's useful for last minute studying and staying fresh. I've got a few notebooks in my office from various certifications, but this time I thought I would put my study sheet into an electronic format and share it with the world. A few thoughts on my notes first:

I like to write notes in the long hierarchy form because I am a visual creature. Every indentation level I see could be a new edit or set hierarchy. If I start in a particular hierarchy, I either talk about it in my notes or specify the [edit] level just as you would see in the CLI. Sometimes my curly brackets do not correctly align with the configuration. It makes no sense to waste 5 lines just for curly brackets.

I use < and > to identify variable names.
I use '/' to identify multiple options
If there is an optional command completion I list it in '( )'

11/6/2013 20:23,Goals,"I used to have a goal in life. Not that I don't have goals anymore, but in this case, I am referring to a specific goal. I had an goal of a job/career that I wanted to do. And lately in my life I've become frustrated because I felt like I've been straying away from this goal, this end-state that I desired. I wanted to be a fancy, big-shot, network engineer. I wanted to work for a big company, maybe do a little traveling, and generally be somebody important. 

But what I've started to realize as I've come a few steps closer to that goal was that I didn't like the life that surrounded it. I'm not comfortable with a lot of travel, I'm not willing to relocate, and I don't like the idea of the long hours it would take to reach that goal. And that was making me mad. I was mad and upset because I wasn't reaching my goal, even though I didn't like the life it required. This has really been bothering me for some time. I was wanting to do X, but felt stuck doing Y, and I was frustrated.

But I just read <a href=""http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2013/11/04/hunter-s-thomspon-letters-of-note-advice/"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>. And it struck me that what I've been doing is actually a much better thing. That article discusses a letter Hunter S. Thompson wrote regarding how to find meaning in your life. And what the author,  Maria Popova, discusses in that article and Thompson's letter is the subject of fixed goals. You set a fixed goal in life, yet you are not in a fixed position in life; your perspective is constantly changing. When you focus on a fixed goal such as a career, you are going to be forced to mold yourself around that goal, changing who you are to achieve that fixed target.

6/21/2013 12:13,Bits on a Wire,"Bits, Frames, Packets, Streams, Datagrams; we have many terms for what basically involves getting information sent across a transmission medium. However, I like details, and I think that the terms should be used correctly. As somebody once told me, ""Words have meanings!"" So let's get a few things straight:

<strong>Bits</strong> - The last logical unit of data before the information is turned into an electrical or optical signal.

<strong>Frames</strong> - Layer 2 data units used to transfer data between adjacent network nodes. Provides frame synchronization (framing) and can provide error detection.

<strong>Packets</strong> - Used to establish the path which data travels from host-to-host. In the world of networking and the OSI model, this strictly refers to Layer 3 (IPv4 or IPv6).

Let's pause right here to make a special note between frames and packets and their uses. Frames are used at L2 to transfer data between adjacent nodes, while packets are used at L3 to transfer data between end-to-end hosts. What this means is that L2 frame headers(src/dst addresses) are rewritten at each node while L3 packet headers (src/dst addresses) do not change.

<strong>Segments/Streams/Datagrams</strong> - Used by Layer 4 protocols to provide end to end communication for applications. Datagram is a term used when delivery, time, or order are not guaranteed by the protocol such as with UDP. Streams/segments are used by protocols such as TCP to guarantee end to end error free communication. A TCP stream is a stream of bytes, not individual messages; meaning that a single TCP stream is a single flow of information. If this single flow of bytes is too large to flow across the network in a single message, it can be segmented or fragmented into smaller pieces.

As network engineers it's our job to ensure that end to end communication is available for the higher layers of our protocol stacks. Now that we know the correct terms for how data is encapsulated so that it can be transported across the network we should start to look at how this data fits across our network. How big are these TCP segments, datagrams, packets and frames flowing across our network? At first it may look like this doesn't matter but when a higher level protocol is trying to cram too much information into the pipes this can cause problems. Just picture connecting a garden hose to a fire hydrant. This is where MTU and MSS come into play.

MTU, Maximum Transmission Unit, is the maximum size of data that a network layer can forward. This means that MTU is/can be different for each layer (Ethernet MTU, IPv4 MTU). TCP uses MSS, Maximum Segment Size, to define the maximum size of data that it will include in an individual TCP segment which would make up a TCP stream. We will talk about MSS in a moment, for now let's focus on MTU.

Differentiating between the physical interface MTU (PHY MTU) and IP MTU can get a little confusing. The PHY MTU is the maximum allowed frame size (not counting the header), or in other words the payload size. IP MTU is the maximum packet size allowed to transmit before fragmentation occurs. Increasing PHY MTU will also increase IP MTU. However decreasing IP MTU will not affect the interface PHY MTU. Why does this matter? In scenarios where we are adding additional headers such as GRE or MPLS. To accommodate the extra protocol overheard of something like GRE, you could lower the IP MTU by 24 bytes to leave room for the GRE overhead without exceeding the PHY MTU.

TCP MSS is the maximum size of data that TCP is willing to RECEIVE in a segment. When a TCP connection is established between two hosts they announce their TCP MSS to each other. It's interesting to note that TCP MSS isn't negotiated and doesn't necessarily have to match.

I'm going to leave you with this little graphic I've borrowed and want to give full credit to @PacketLife 's <a href=""http://packetlife.net/blog/2008/nov/5/mtu-manipulation/"" target=""_blank"">blog post on MTU Manipulation</a>:

What this means is that L2 frame headers(src/dst addresses) are rewritten at each node while L3 packet headers (src/dst addresses) do not change.

Segments/Streams/Datagrams - Used by Layer 4 protocols to provide end to end communication for applications. Datagram is a term used when delivery, time, or order are not guaranteed by the protocol (UDP). Streams/segments are used by protocols such as TCP to guarantee end to end error free communication. A TCP stream is a stream of bytes, not individual messages; meaning that a single TCP stream is a single flow of information. If this single flow of bytes is too large to flow across the network in a single message, it can be segmented or fragmented into smaller pieces.

As network engineers it's our job to ensure that end to end communication is available for the higher layers of our protocol stacks. Now that we know the correct terms for how data is encapsulated so that it can be transported across the network we should start to look at how this data fits across our network. How big are these TCP segments, datagrams, packets and frames flowing across our network? At first it may look like this doesn't matter but when a higher level protocol is trying to cram too much information into the pipes this can cause problems. Just picture connecting a garden hose to a fire hydrant. This is where MTU and MSS come into play.

MTU, Maximum Transmission Unit, is the maximum size of data that a network layer can forward. This means that MTU is/can be different for each layer (Ethernet MTU, IPv4 MTU). TCP uses MSS, Maximum Segment Size, to define the maximum size of data that it will include in an individual TCP segment which would make up a TCP stream. We will talk about MSS in a moment, for now let's focus on MTU.

Differentiating between the physical interface MTU (PHY MTU) and IP MTU can get a little confusing. The PHY MTU is the maximum allowed frame size (not counting the header), or in other words the payload size. IP MTU is the maximum packet size allowed to transmit before fragmentation occurs. Increasing PHY MTU will also increase IP MTU. However decreasing IP MTU will not affect the interface PHY MTU. Why does this matter? In scenarios where we are adding additional headers such as GRE or MPLS. To accommodate the extra protocol overheard of something like GRE, you could lower the IP MTU by 24 bytes to leave room for the GRE overhead without exceeding the PHY MTU.

TCP MSS is the maximum size of data that TCP is willing to RECEIVE in a segment. When a TCP connection is established between two hosts they announce their TCP MSS to each other. It's interesting to note that TCP MSS isn't negotiated and doesn't necessarily have to match.

My family, loved ones, and people in general deserve more than interruptions. Heck, even the task that I should be doing now deserves more focus than the constant interruptions I submit myself to. If I'm constantly checking my phone, or my email, or whatever feed, I am diverting from attention from what really matters in life.

This realization has been some time coming. I was driving the other day when I noticed a little boy riding his bike on the side walk, a few feet behind him trailed his mom. Focused entirely on her cell phone. It looked sad. The little boy looked like he was having a great time riding his bike, but his mom seemed to be paying no attention that excitement. What a shame it is that we can't focus on the here and now. Or maybe people are trying to focus on the here and now, but looking in the wrong places. Do I want my son to grow up having to constantly fight for attention with a cell phone?! Absolutely not.

I'm done with it. I'm done with the white noise stealing my attention from what really matters. Today I'm turning off all the notifications on my phone. I will not be constantly checking my email, or Twitter, or Facebook.

Some people rely on the post-it note system. For me, this doesn't cut it. I am constantly juggling multiple projects and tasks, many of which are hurry up and wait scenarios. I work on a project and then have to be able to come back to it and pick back up where I left off. Or sometimes I need save a config snippet I did, or templates I've used to deploy port configurations. Which brings me to one of my favorite (yet anti-climatic) tools, <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a>.

I use Notepad++ for multiple reasons, one of the biggest is tabs. I have created a folder (obviously called Notes), which I save all of my information to. When I get a call, or start to work a ticket, I immediately open a new tab (Ctrl+N) and start to work. When I'm done I can look at it and either close the tab without saving, or save it to my Notes folder. I like having multiple tabs open because I reference some things multiple times a day and it makes it much easier than constantly browsing for a file.

The next big reason I use Notepad++ is for the column editing mode. Instead of deleting or inserting at the beginning of each line 10 times, you can use Column Editing mode to do it all at once. To do this just Alt+Click in the document. This feature along with search and replace makes it easy to take the output from a show command, modify it with search+replace, and turn it into a script to paste back into the device.

There is also a handy <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-compare/"" target=""_blank"">Compare Plugin for Notepad++</a> that can be useful for comparing config changes.

As network engineers we spend most of our time at the Command Line Interface. This involves a lot of time spent with terminal emulation programs. I like <a href=""http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"" target=""_blank"">PuTTY</a> and it's great in a pinch, but if you work in a large environment I strongly suggest you check out <a href=""http://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/"" target=""_blank"">SecureCRT</a>. It is pricey ($100 for 1yr of updates), but I feel it is an investment well worth it. Well managed tabs and organized saved sessions are absolute life-savers.

One of the biggest things I've learned to do with SecureCRT is setup auto-logging. To do this you have to edit the session options and you can specify the log file name and how you want to save your logs using convenient variables. I do this in-case I fat-finger a command and generally having logs is always a good thing. It's also an easy way to capture the crazy output that is ""show tech"" for TAC cases.
<h2>Task Management</h2>
The final tool I'm going to mention is a webapp I use to manage my project tasks. There are plenty of apps out there. The one I've settled on using is <a href=""https://www.nirvanahq.com/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>. It is a Getting Things Done (GTD) based web app and also has an iOS client. I like it primarily because I can group my tasks into projects. Being GTD based, it has a folder/view for Next items (stuff I need to be doing now) and Project folders/views (for stuff that isn't immediate). I also like that it has Contexts and areas to filter your tasks (great for separating home and work tasks and projects).
<h2>The Take-Away</h2>
Build yourself a system. I'm sure you have plenty of issues, methods, and opinions that make every situation unique. These are the tools I've discovered that best suite me, but there are plenty more out there. Don't settle for mediocrity when it comes to tools you use on a daily basis, craftsmen don't and you shouldn't either.",,

2/12/2013 9:45,Cisco AAA,"Controlling who can play with you networking equipment is somewhat important. If you run the kind of network where you don't care who can log in and lab on your gear then you can probably skip this post. But for the rest of us, I'm going to cover Cisco's AAA features and what good they are to us as network engineers/admins. 

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, and is most commonly used to control administrative access to our boxes. Authentication is all about identity; can you who you are by providing the correct password? Authorization is kind of like the hall pass; I know you're allowed in this building, but are you allowed down this hall? And finally Accounting is big brother's spy eye, keeping track of what you're doing and how long you spent doing it. 

Now AAA isn't just used to control admin access, it actually can operate in two types or modes. The first mode is <strong>Character</strong> mode and is used to control remote admin access for line(vty, console) or EXEC mode commands. The other mode is <strong>Packet</strong> mode and is used to control remote network access for things such as VPN or PPP users. AAA can also either local(internal) or external services. Local or internal services use an internal database for users, while the external service can use either Cisco ACS or other type of control server using RADIUS or TACACS+. Because AAA and TACACS+ are Cisco systems/protocols they obviously offer more robustness over the standard RADIUS implementations. Most notably, TACACS+ separates all 3 functions of AAA to allow for more granularity while RADIUS combines Authentication and Authorization. Also, TACACS+ encrypts the entire packet body, while RADIUS only encrypts the password attribute portion of a Access-Request packet.

Configuration of AAA is fairly straightforward. You have to enable AAA with the <strong>aaa new-model</strong> global config command, and then specify your TACACS+ servers using the <strong>tacacs-server host &lt;ip&gt; key &lt;password&gt;</strong> global config command. From there you can then enable each facet of AAA as desired. 

To configure login authentication to use all configured TACACS+ servers with a local database as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local</strong>
To configure enable accounting to use all configured TACACS+ servers with the configured enable secret as a backup, use the command:
<strong>aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable</strong>

I would go into a little detail regarding authorization, but unless you have a teams that are only allowed to issue certain commands, such as a NOC only being allowed to configure or reset certain settings, then I feel that authorization is useless. You can Google to the Cisco docs if you think you really need this feature.

To configure accounting of sessions and commands entered to a TACACS+ server, use the commands:
<strong>aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 0 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
<strong>aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs+</strong>
(We don't use any any privilege levels other than 0 or 15, but if you wish you can specify any value from 0-15).",,

How true. I made plans, big plans. CCIE baby! Yea, I can do this! And then life happened. I'm not complaining, it's all about priorities right? And right now I've got an 18 month old little ball of energy bouncing around my living room which takes priority over all. Anyway, I had grandiose plans to tackle my CCIE, which I downgraded to CCNP after realizing that, without employer support, there was just no way I could afford to sit the lab exam. The CCNP exam isn't really cheap either, and I just got an email stating my CCNA expires in March. 

So I've decided in an effort to save my CCNA and secure another certification at the same time, I'm just going to renew it via the CCNA Security exam. I took an assessment on Cisco.com and scored a 68% without any studying, so I think if I brush up on my VPNs I'll be doing pretty good. I find it kind of funny that I had planned to tackle the CCIE but instead will be taking another CCNA exam. But alas, life happens. Right now I've got a solid job, it's just that my employer puts little if any stock in certifications. 

So I'll start cramming for my CCNA Security (be expecting some IPSEC posts to follow soon), and I'll look to take the CCNP exams when I find a spare $600 in the sofa cushions.",,

Thought I'd share a little good news... I took my JNCIA-EX exam today, and I passed! The Juniper exam seems to be a little more JUNOS orientated instead of the networking fundamentals that the CCNA containted. There were no subnetting questions, and the exam almost assumes a prior knowledge of the networking basics (though the O'Reilly JUNOS Ent. Switching book does cover the basics). 

Overall I'd say it was a good exam and I look forward to starting my study for the JNCIS-ENT.",,
9/3/2012 17:39,What is QFabric?,"Yesterday Juniper released another piece to the Project Stratus puzzle. Project Stratus is Juniper's attempt at a 3-2-1 process of flattening the data center hierarchy model. They introduced the new <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/qfx-series/qfx3500/"">QFX3500 switch</a>, and the concept of <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/whitepapers/2000384-en.pdf"">QFabric</a>. As always, Twitter went crazy. I did enjoy the back and forth, it was educational listening to different perspectives from people much smarter than myself. A small debate broke out whether or not Juniper's QFabric was different from Cisco's FabricPath. I'm writing this article to hopefully entice some other opinions or blog replies. I'm sure not an expert, but I'm going to do my best to explain what I think the differences are. I'm not going to say one is better than the other, but to myself they do appear different.

<strong>Hardware</strong>

The QFX3500 is a 1U 48port 10GE switch, fully L2/L3 capable. This box seems similar to the Cisco Nexus 5548 switch. Not much to get excited about here, it was about time Juniper released something comparable.

Is there a major difference? I'm thinking no.

<strong>The Design, Stratus, QFabric</strong>

Project Stratus is supposed to consist of the QFX3500s linked back to a large chassis switch, which has yet to be released, using Juniper's new QSFP+ ports. This is supposed to yield an extension of the control plane(packets are processed once at ingress to the ""fabric""), and a single point of management. This concept sounds to me like how the Nexus 7000 can now support Nexus 2000s hanging off of it. I see two differences here: <del>1. Cisco does it with standard SFP+ ports</del>(I made the mistake of not researching the standard QSFP+ ports Juniper uses), and 2. The Nexus 2000 is little more than a dumb line-card and does not do any packet processing. I'm not sure if the method how the Stratus/QFX3500 or the Nexus 7k/2k uplink is much different(i.e. fex-fabric ports vs. Juniper's yet to be released config info), I plan on doing some more research into that.

Is there a major difference? I think a few small details, but the design is quite similar.

<strong>FabricPath = QFabric?</strong>

According to Cisco, FabricPath ""brings the stability and scalability of routing to Layer 2."" FabricPath is more of a L2 domain control innovation, or a stop-gap to TRILL/SPB, than a control plane extension. However, if you look at the FEX Fabric that links Nexus 5k&gt;2k or 7k&gt;2k, now that is a more accurate comparison to QFabric. With FEX Fabric and QFabric, the packet is processed once, and forwarded directly to it's destination. FabricPath still relies on multiple switch hops to operate. I think Juniper looks at from the view that if the network operates like one giant switch fabric, then there are no multiple hops and therefore no need for TRILL/SPB.

Is FabricPath = QFabric? I don't think so. But it does sound similar to Cisco's FEX Fabric.

<strong>Vaporware?</strong>

Yes. Juniper has only released the QFX3500 switch, which today can be used as a standard 10GE ToR switch. For Project Stratus to come together they still have to release their director chassis switch which will then use QFabric to interconnect the QFX3500s.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

First I'm a little disappointed in Juniper for being so vague. If I hadn't already talked to our Juniper reps about this release, I think I would be even more confused. Is QFabric similar to FabricPath? I still don't think so, but I'm open to being educated. Is QFabric revolutionary? At first I thought it was, but after seeing the Twitter-discussion, I'm not so sure now.

9/3/2012 17:39,Twinax/DAC Cable Differences,"I am currently in the process of implementing Juniper EX4500 switches to deliver 10GE connectivity to our ESX host servers. During this process we decided to go the route of direct attach copper (DAC) cables to save money. We dug around what little research we could find and eventually decided to purchase Brocade converged network adapters (CNAs) to install in our servers. When we finally got around to mocking up this setup in our lab this week we ran into a major issue. I was unable to get the physical link between the server and the switch to come up. We swapped out the cable to try this Brocade DAC cable we just happened to have laying around and the link came right up. That was interesting, so we started doing a little research...

Are all DAC cables created equally? The answer is no. There are two types of DAC cables: Active and Passive. Scientific Computer has a <a href=""http://www.scientificcomputing.com/High-speed-Copper-Interconnects-Address-Critical-HPCHurdles.aspx"" target=""_blank"">good article</a> listing the differences between active and passive cables.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-286"" title=""DAC Cables"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg?w=300"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>You can see here three different cables. The one on the left is the Brocade active cable. The middle is the Juniper passive cable, and the one on the right is a Cisco passive cable. You can see the contact pad difference between the active and passive cables.

What does this mean to us network engineers? Vendor support. Not every vendor supports both passive and active cables, while some vendors require active cables. Take our situation for example: Juniper does not currently support active DAC cables, however the Brocade CNAs we purchased will only work with an active cable. This put us in a tight spot. Take this opportunity to learn from our mistake, check with your vendors regarding passive/active cable support if you are planning on implementing 10GE direct-attach copper cables.",,

9/3/2012 17:39,2011 Predictions and Resolutions,"2010 is almost gone. It has been a good year with many new developments, but now it's time to start looking forward. So here is my $0.02 on what I think the new year will have in store for us:
<ul>
	<li>I predict we will see networking products become more tightly integrated with virtualization products such as VMware. Some companies are already starting to deliver products which integrate with vCenter, but I expect to see many more.</li>
	<li>TRILL/SPB will gain traction and we might possibly see it start to be implemented towards the end of the 2011.</li>
	<li>I'm going to step out there and say that FCoE won't gain much traction in 2011. I think protocols such as iSCSI or NFS will continue to improve, and we may see the development of a new protocol.</li>
	<li>Frame relay will continue to die a slow death at the hands of MPLS.</li>
</ul>
Any my personal resolutions for 2011:
<ul>
	<li>Get that CCNP and JNCIS. I'd like to have these completed by summer time so I can begin reading for my CCIE studies.</li>
	<li>Really understand MPLS.</li>
	<li>Make time for my family. I'm going to be having a baby in 2011 and I am going to make that my #1 priority.</li>

9/3/2012 17:39,Hands on Hardware - Juniper,"
So we've recently decided to consolidate our two existing data centers into a single data center and move them to an off-site co-location. Part of this new project involved redesigning our data center network. Let me tell you, know is an exciting time to be building a new data center. We looked at Cisco, Juniper, and Brocade to get their proposals for our new data center. Brocade at the time did not have a 10GE top-of-rack switch. Cisco, with their Nexus line looked like a solid option, though the missing L3 functionality in the 5020 pushed us away. In the end, Juniper had a solid offering at a competitive price. There was some hesitation moving away from an all Cisco network, though in the end we are pleased with our decision.

Our design consists of SRX650s for our edge, EX4500s in the top-of-rack, and also EX4500s for our core. We debated what to put in the core, but with our small footprint (we're looking at two racks once we are more virtualized) we decided that the EX4500s would suffice. There will also be some 4200s and 2200s for some other peripheral uses.

Well we cut POs, and the blue boxes have started to show up. I thought I'd share some pictures I took while I was inventorying and assembling the devices and modules. 

The new EX2200:

9/3/2012 17:39,Optimizing e-Books for Kindle,"<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-356"" title=""Before"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""491"" height=""277"" /></a>

I've recently started uploading more technical documents to my Kindle for ease of access. But to compete with paper documents, I have to be able to access the information quickly. This means I rely heavily on the navigation built into the Kindle. I like to be able to jump straight to the Table of Contents, click on the chapter I want, or be able to quickly skip chapters. So what's wrong with this picture? This comes from a PDF e-book I purchased from CiscoPress and copied to my Kindle. There are 3 major things I have a problem with in this PDF. 1. There are no click-able links in the Table of Contents. 2. The Go To menu is missing an entry for the Table of Contents. 3. There are no tick marks to use the five-way controller for navigation. These are pretty major problems for me because it only allows me to read the document straight through, however I'd much rather be able to skip around through the book. Let's see if there is a better way to do this...

What we're going to do is convert the PDF to a PRC file. This will allow us to create the navigation that we want, but it will take a little extra leg work in order to properly apply the finishing touches.

1. First, Download and Install <a href=""http://www.mobipocket.com/en/DownloadSoft/ProductDetailsCreator.asp"" target=""_blank"">Mobipocket eBook Creator</a>

2. Import Your PDF for Conversion
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-360 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot006"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""472"" /></a></p>

3. Locate and Set the Cover Image
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-369 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot008"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""461"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-370 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot009"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""471"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">4. Next we have to edit the .HTML file so that we can find the HTML Anchor names to create our TOC item on the Go To menu.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-373"" title=""ScreenShot010"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""434"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here we can see that there is an anchor named ""link1"" designating the Contents page in the book. We'll now add this reference as a TOC Guide Item.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-374"" title=""ScreenShot011"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""470"" /></a>To create the link, we select the .HTML file by browsing for it, and then appending the HTML anchor of the Contents page. Next we need to save the project to create the .OPF Mobipocket project file.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">6. At this point we can either call it quits and build the .PRC file, or we can push forward and create a .NCX file so that we can use the five-way controller for navigation. I agree, let's move on and do this right.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Araby Greene wrote a great guest article <a href=""http://www.cjs-easy-as-pie.com/p/create-ncx-file-by-araby-greene.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> discussing the NCX file and it's use in-depth. I suggest you read the article and then come back for a high-level of what you need to add a NCX file to your project. Alright, now that you're back let's build our NCX file. You will have to go back to the original .HTML file we edited and search for more anchor names for each of the chapters, and also any other items such as preface, index, appendix, etc. that you may want to add. For my test example I used the Contents page, and Chapter 1 and 2:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-376"" title=""ScreenShot012"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""432"" /></a>The key items needed to create the navPoints are an id, the sequential playOrder (the order for the ticks), the text for the label, and the HTML link and anchor.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here is a building block example:</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE ncx PUBLIC ""-//NISO//DTD ncx 2005-1//EN"" 
  ""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx-2005-1.dtd""&gt;
&lt;ncx xmlns=""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/""  
  version=""2005-1"" xml:lang=""en-US""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:uid"" content=""uid""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:depth"" content=""1""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:totalPageCount"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:maxPageNumber"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;docTitle&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Title&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docTitle&gt;
&lt;docAuthor&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Author&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docAuthor&gt;
&lt;navMap&gt;
&lt;navPoint id=""uniqueID"" playOrder=""1""&gt;
&lt;navLabel&gt;&lt;text&gt;TextLabel&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/navLabel&gt;
&lt;content src=""link.html#anchor""/&gt;
&lt;/navPoint&gt;
&lt;/navMap&gt;
&lt;/ncx&gt;
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">7. Next, save this file as TOC.ncx and place it in the Publication folder.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">8. Now we have to edit the .OPF project file to add insert a reference to the .NCX file:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The code to paste is:</p>

<pre>&lt;item id=""ncx"" media-type=""application/x-dtbncx+xml"" href=""toc.ncx""&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/manifest&gt;&lt;spine toc=""ncx""&gt;&lt;itemref idref=""item1""/&gt;&lt;/spine&gt;</pre>
You are essentially adding an item to the manifest and rewriting the spine.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-377"" title=""ScreenShot015"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""433"" /></a>9. Now we can save the .OPF and build the .PRC

10. We can download and install the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621"" target=""_blank"">Kindle Previewer</a> to open up the .PRC and verify the tick marks show up. Next we can copy the .PRC to the Kindle and enjoy an easily navigable reference document.

And voila...
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-378 aligncenter"" title=""After"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""478"" height=""270"" /></a>We now have click-able links in our Contents page, a shortcut to the Contents page in the Go To menu, and tick marks we can use to skip chapters using the five-way controller. A few caveats though: when importing the PDF into Mobipocket it might not create a link for every item in the table of contents. This could easily be fixed by modifying the .HTML file and adding anchors and links. I feel as long as I get the chapters linked I'm 80% happy. I also noticed that the 13.6mb PDF file I first started with turned into a 6.4mb PRC file.</p>
So if you are as detailed orientated as I am, you can now enjoy your tech docs in geeky bliss.

Merry Christmas!",,
9/3/2012 17:39,New Year and New Beginnings,"I feel blessed to be kicking off 2011 with a fresh start at a new company. It's felt like a crazy few weeks going through the interview process and then the transition between companies. I thought I should take a minute to reflect back on the experience and share any insights I came across.
<ul>
	<li>Have a clean simple resume, and bring a copy with you to the interview. I brought a notebook (professional looking) with me to take notes of peoples names, responsibilities, and notes when considering a possible offer.</li>
	<li>Don't lie. If you're unfamiliar with a topic or technology, don't be afraid to say so. If you want to save face you could say, ""I'm not familiar with technology X, but I have experience with Y which is a similar technology."" However if you don't know something, you don't know something. It's not the end of the world.</li>
	<li>Have a bio for yourself. This is one I stumbled through and wish I was more prepared for. When asked, ""Tell me a little about your past experience"", you should have a well thought out answer. We all know what we've done at our past jobs, we wrote it down in our resumes, but did you rehearse speaking out loud a quick bio? It would be best to customize or tweak this bio to highlight your strengths that match with the opportunities' position requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask questions. If you're genuinely interested in an opportunity, I believe it will show in your curiosity to learn about the organization and the position requirements. A few things to consider include: the organizational structure of the company and more importantly the IT department, current coworkers that you would be working alongside with, and any future plans or projects in the works.</li>

9/3/2012 17:39,10GE Killed the Hub,"I was talking to a fellow network engineer the other day showing off our new 10GE equipment and he made a comment how 10GE was a totally different technology than standard Ethernet because it did not use CSMA/CD. I acknowledged I didn't know what he was talking about and ran off to do some research, at which point I feel I fell into the Ethernet rabbit hole. I thought I would share my finding with you.

Let's get down and dirty with a quick overview of the base layers of the OSI model:

Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is compromised of both physical and data-link layer protocols that define the technology we network engineers all know and love. 

The data link layer consists of two sub-layers. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer. The MAC is a communication protocol sub-layer that provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms. In other words the MAC layer is pretty much our beloved 48-bit MAC addresses and CSMA/CD. MAC operates between the LLC sublayer and the physical layer to emulate full duplex communication. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing so that muliple network protocols can coexist on the same media (such as IP &amp; IPX), and also provides flow control mechanisms. The LLC sub-layer acts as an interface between the MAC sublayer and the network layer.

Duplex is a method that two units communicate with each other in both directions. Half-duplex provides communication in both directions but only one direction at a time. Full duplex allows bi-directional communication simultaneously. Half-duplex can lead to collisions and re-transmissions (hence the need for CSMA/CD.) Full duplex allows communication simultaneously in both directions so there are no collisions. In full-duplex communication, a MAC layer is not necessary though it is still implemented for hardware addressing purposes. A hub is a good example of half-duplex communication.

Carrier Sense Multiple Acces (CSMA) is a MAC protocol in which a node verifies the absense of traffic before transmitting on a shared medium. CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a modification of CSMA that improves performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected. 

Flow Control is implemented in Ethernet with 802.1x when one station is sending traffic faster than the other 
station can receive it. When this happens a station sends a PAUSE command to a bridge group address and all data is stopped. On a side note: This messes with Classes of Service (802.1p) because all priorities are stopped. One of the new Data Center Bridging protocols, Priority Flow Control (802.1Qbb), attempts to address this issue by indicating pause time for each priority separately.

Now back to the original comment:
1000BASE-T supports autonegotiation of half-duplex communication when necessary. 10GE defines only full duplex links, so half-duplex and therefore CSMA/CD do not exist. The statement by my fellow engineer is correct, 10GE is missing CSMA/CD. However since Gigabit Ethernet, when operating in full duplex, doesn't utilize CSMA/CD either, I now consider it a bold statement that 10GE is totally different from standard Gig Ethernet. It could be said however that 10GE killed the hub!",,
9/3/2012 17:38,Whiteboard - Converged Data Center Network,"<img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-112"" title=""ConvergedNetwork Whiteboard"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/100_06421.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""767"" />

Let's look at this from bottom to the top:

Layer 1 of the OSI Model gives us 10GE or 10 Gigabit Ethernet. 10GE is standardized as IEEE 802.3-2008 which covers the various physical layer flavors such as 10GBASE-SR.

Layer 2 defines our Data Link protocols such as FiberChannel and Ethernet; we'll focus on the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet has been stretched out to cover many various enhancements under IEEE 802.1. In the converged data center network there is a demand for improvements over our standard ""lossy"" Ethernet. This is where DCB, or Data Center Bridging, comes into play. DCB is a collection of enhancements to the 802.1 Ethernet standard that can transform Ethernet to ""lossless"". These enhancements include 802.1Qau, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. Fore more information on these enhancements check out the<a href=""http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/dcbridges.html"" target=""_blank""> IEEE DCB Task Group</a>. DCB is the term for these enhancements used by the IEEE. DCE, or Data Center Ethernet, is Cisco's trademarked term based on these enhancements. CEE, or Converged Enhanced Ethernet, is trademarked by IBM and used by companies such as Juniper. I think it is important to note that while all of these terms mean the same thing, none have been ratified as a standard.

Layer 3 is where FCoE, or Fiber Channel over Ethernet, calls home. FCoE is the encapsulation of Fiber Channel frames into Ethernet frames. Because Fiber Channel is a loss-less protocol it requires the enhancements to Ethernet as found in DCB. One important item to note is that because FCoE lives at Layer 3 it is not able to route across IP networks.

I threw iSCSI in there where it lives in Layer 5 so that you can see how iSCSI traffic is able to route across our IP networks. Hopefully seeing this drawn out based on OSI layers can give you a better grasp of the technologies and their buzzwords.

9/3/2012 17:38,CCNA,"<img class=""aligncenter"" title=""CCNA Logo"" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2699/4443221390_cffd097418_o.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />I have to apologize for not taking some time off, however I have had my nose in a book for the past month studying for my ICND2 exam. I've been preparing mostly by reading, practicing subnetting, and practicing on the exam simulator. I went yesterday morning to take my exam... and passed!! I'm now a full CCNA! I am still excited and I feel like I have had a large burden taken off my shoulders.

I thought I would share a few quick tips, or at least things that helped me study:
<ul>
	<li>Subnetting - Practice, Practice, Practice
I study subnetting in two ways: memorizing my chart and then practicing to find the subnet address. For the ICND2 or CCNA exam, I would recommend adding the wildcard masks as a column to remember, it might come in handy. I practiced writing my chart top to bottom, left to right, and then backwards just to make sure I knew it. I timed myself a few days before the exam to see how long it took me to copy the entire chart /20 - /30, it only took me about 2 minutes. That makes it well worth it to write down the chart once the exam begins to have as a reference later.
I also practiced subnetting by practicing finding the subnet address and the range for that subnet. I found a great site online that provides random practice problems <a href=""http://faculty.valleycollege.net/rpowell/jscript/subnet2.htm"">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Exam Simulator
I also spent a good bit of time on the exam simulator trying to answer the study questions. Honestly as I was using the exam simulator I didn't do as well as I had hoped and was nervous about taking my real exam. However, the questions on the actual exam seemed to be a little easier, so after taking the exam I felt exam simulator did a great job of helping me to prepare.</li>
	<li>Real-World Experience
I have to say real-world experience is invaluable on the exam. I had already configured VLANs and ACLs and spent some time with STP so I felt comfortable with those questions. The company I work for utilizes a MPLS network and we only have a few legacy frame relay circuits still alive, so those questions seemed to prove the most difficult for me.</li>
</ul>
I would like to encourage anyone else wanting to take CCNA exam to go ahead and schedule the exam, study hard, and just do it.",,
9/3/2012 17:38,OSPF Overview Notes,"Summary:
Routers form neighbors and send LSAs (link state announcements). As a router receives LSAs, it uses them to build the LSDB (link state database), applies SPF algorithm to LSDB to select the best routes to populate the routing table.

1. Neighbor discovery
Multicast hellos sent to 224.0.0.5 for neighbor discovery
Must meet requirements:
Same subnet
Hello/dead intervals match
Ip mtu match
Pass authentication
Unique router ids
If routers meet requirements they move to the 2-way state and are then able to move forward with topology exchange. Hellos continue to be sent to monitor responsiveness.

2. Topology exchange
After neighbors form, they exchange LSA headers via DD (database description) messages. The DD messages allow the router to learn what it does not know so that it can request only the complete LSAs it needs. For missing LSAs the router sends a LSR (link state request) which is replied with by a LSU (link state update) and then acknowledged by a LSAck (link state acknowledgement). When all LSAs have been exchanged and both routers have identical LSDBs, they move to the fully adjacent state.

When a DR (designated router) exists, all routers exchange databases only with the DR via a Type 2 LSA psuedo node. DROther (non-dr) nodes send updates to multicast 224.0.0.6 which are processed only by the DR and BDR. Essentially all DROther routers exchange databases only with the DR which then relays back to the rest of the DROthers. This is why only neighborships with the DR will be FULL while neighborships between DROthers remain in a 2-way state.

3. Route selection
Router searches LSDB to find all possible routes to a destination. For each route, the router adds up OSPF interface costs for all outgoing interfaces. The router will then pick the route with the lowest total cost and add the route to the routing table.",,
9/3/2012 17:38,EIGRP Neighbor Notes,"<h2>Process Overview:</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Neighbor Discovery</strong> - Hellos sent to multicast address 224.0.0.10 based on Hello Timer Interval. If requirements are met routers become neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Initial Topology Exchange</strong> - Once routers become neighbors they will complete a full topology exchange. Topology information is sent via Update messages sent to multicast address 224.0.0.10 via RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Route Selection</strong> - Router calculates the metric for each route and populates the routing table with the best routes. If multiple equal cost routes exist EIGRP will put both routes in the routing table and perform load-balancing. If multiple unequal routes exist, higher cost routes will be kept in the topology table as Feasible Successor routes for faster convergence if a topology change occurs.</li>

There was one question concerning configuring syslog to send messages on OSPF updates that I felt inadequate to answer.

9/3/2012 17:38,Data Center Move,"I was trying to think of my next blog post and I was running out of ideas when it hit me that we're moving data centers! Not only are we moving data centers, we are collapsing two data centers into a single data center through virtualization. We are also spinning off a division of our company as a standalone entity with it's own infrastructure.

To bring you up to speed, we are breaking this into 4 large projects: 1. Setting up the new data center infrastructure for both companies. 2. Moving the spin-off company to their new data center. 3. Collapsing/moving the Southern data center to the new data center, and then finally 4. Moving the main data center. We currently have about 70 physical servers and 70 virtual servers. We are a VMWare shop and plan on either P2V'ing the physical servers or just rebuilding them as virtual and migrating data, when all is said and one we are expecting to have around 200-250 virtual machines and are not expecting to run into any machines that we can't virtualize.

We started out with the idea of building out our own data center, but when we got down to engineering it out at our location, cooling costs were going to blow our budget. Also, because we are a relatively small IT department we weren't too excited about having to manage the cooling, power, generators, etc. which eventually led us to look for hosted racks at a larger provider.

So far we have been spending most of this year researching vendors and trying to design our brand-new data center. We have been researching SANs, switches, backup solutions, VMWare, servers. So much stuff in such a short period of time that my head hurts at times. But what a great learning experience, one that I hope to share with you as we progress through this project.",,
9/3/2012 17:37,Work-Life Balance,"In the past few months I've graduated college, started a new job, achieved the next technical certification, but most importantly I've become a father. Each day I barely have time to catch my breath before I wake up and start all over. Becoming a father has caused me to pause and re-assess my situation, to re-evaluate my priorities. I began to think about this ""work-life balance"" and just how crazy the notion is. Since when did work start competing with <strong>LIFE</strong>? Life is the only real thing. Our families and living should not be competing with <em>work</em> for our time and attention. I don't just mean that we should just be focusing more on our families, but we should also be taking care of ourselves, both physically and spiritually. We all know that sitting in a chair from 8-5 isn't exactly improving our physique. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that work isn't important, or that we shouldn't strive to be the best at whatever it is we choose to do. What I am saying is that we should not forget the reason why we are working.

Enjoy life.

8/14/2012 7:24,Cisco VACL for IDS Monitoring,"Instead of using a SPAN or VSPAN port to capture traffic for an IDS it is more efficient to target specific traffic for monitoring. This can be completed at a much more granular level by using a VACL. VACLs are more efficient because they only target specific traffic and they are also enforced in hardware, so the performance impact is lower.  To setup a VACL for IDS monitoring you need 4 main components: an access-list identifying interesting traffic, a VLAN access-map to capture the traffic, a VLAN filter to apply the access-map, and a capture port to send the traffic to.

You actually need 2 ACLs, one to identify interesting traffic and another to permit all traffic, the latter will be crucial in building the access-map.
<pre>ip access-list extended MONITOR
  permit ip 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
  permit ip host 198.51.100.23 any
  permit ip host 198.51.100.24 any
exit

ip access-list extended ALL_TRAFFIC
  permit ip any any
exit</pre>

We then use these ACLs to build our VLAN access-map.
<pre>vlan access-map MONITOR 10
  match ip address MONITOR
  action forward capture
vlan access-map MONITOR 20
  match ip address ALL_TRAFFIC
  action forward
exit</pre>
The key here is the ""action forward capture"", this will continue to forward the packet and also send it to our capture port. We also must add another statement so that all other legitimate traffic will continue to be forwarded. If we did not, traffic that wasn't matched as interesting by the first ACL would just get dropped by the access-map.

Next we need to apply our access-map to the VLANs we wish to monitor.
<pre>vlan filter MONITOR vlan-list 6,28,30,58</pre>

And finally configure our capture port which will have the IDS tap connected to it.
<pre>interface Gi1/20
  description IDS Port
  switchport capture allowed vlan 6,28,30,58
  switchport capture</pre>

""Switchport capture"" has some interesting effects on the interface. Unless you want to apply dot1q tags no further interface config is necessary. If you want to apply the dot1q tags, configure the port as a trunk without negotiation. The capture port only supports egress traffic; if you you do a show interface you will see (along with only packets output): 
<pre>6509#  sh int gi1/20
GigabitEthernet1/20 is up, line protocol is down (monitoring)
  ...</pre>

Finally, we can verify our config by checking the access-map and the vlan filter:
<pre>6509#sh vlan access-map MONITOR
Vlan access-map ""MONITOR""  10
        match: ip address MONITOR
        action: forward capture
Vlan access-map ""MONITOR""  20
        match: ip address ALL_TRAFFIC

",,
2/21/2012 20:21,Rethinking Scripting,"I recently wrote a post stating I was beginning learning scripting to aid in my network administration tasks. I had initially stated I was going to use Perl for this. Then I tried to write a script at work, but I'm not allowed to install unauthorized software on my machine, much less multiple machines or servers. We are also a Windows shop, so unfortunately no built-in scripting for me. Or so I thought. I overheard our Windows admin group talking about their Powershell scripts and this got me thinking. Can I use Powershell to write scripts for network device administration? It would make a great platform mostly because its authorized and it's built-in to Windows 7 and Server 2008. I started to do some research and one of the first things I came across was the use of the command line version of PuTTY called PLink to SSH into boxes and then pass commands. I started down this path, but it wasn't long before I began running into problems. Problems either passing commands through PLink or being unable to capture the entire output when running multiple commands. I had to find a better way.

I did some more research and discovered the use of a library called <a href=""http://huddledmasses.org/scriptable-ssh-from-powershell/"" target=""_blank"">SharpSSH in Powershell</a>. Now this is what I was looking for. In his post, Joel wrote a few Powershell functions using the SharpSSH library. All I have to do is store the DLLs some place and update the script with their location. The Invoke-SSH function he wrote closely mimics Expect scripts. You run a command and then 'expect' the prompt. This allows the function to know when the command is complete, something I was seriously hurting for using PLink.

I'm a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel, so what I did was take Joel's functions and use them in a manner that would benefit myself and maybe other network admins.?ÿLet me walk you through a quick script I wrote utilizing Joel's functions:

First I want to create my SSH session:
<pre>New-SshSession root 192.168.1.1 ## Will be prompted for password
if (Receive-SSH '%')
{
#root prompt
Write-Host ""Logged in as root. Starting CLI.""
$a = Invoke-SSH ""cli"" '&gt;'
$rootlogin = 'true'
}</pre>
Now you may ask why I created the if statement to check if I received the % prompt. If you're a Juniper engineer then you would know that % is the shell prompt you receive if you log in as root. I know I hard-coded sending the root username, but in future posts I will share a snippet that will allow for more dynamic entry of username/password combos, and if it happens to be the root user, then we would like to send CLI to start the CLI and enter operational mode. The Invoke-SSH function sends command 'cli' and expects the operational prompt &gt;. I used the variable to call the function because I didn't want it to write any output at this time so I capture it in the variable and sit on it. I also set a variable to true if logged in as root, for use later in the script.

Next I want to download the entire config for my backup folder:
<pre>#Invoke-SSH outputs the command(first line), the output, and the expected string line(EOF)
$a = Invoke-SSH ""show config | no-more"" '&gt;'
$a|out-file showconfig.txt
Write-Host ""Config Backup Complete.""</pre>
Here I use a variable to call the Invoke-SSH function and send the command ""show config | no-more"". Once the command is done executing we should be back at the operational mode prompt, therefore I expect &gt;. I then use out-file to write the variable to a text file, and write-host to display a little status message.

I then want to cleanly close out the session:
<pre>#Extra exit when logged in as root.
if ($rootlogin='true')
{
Write-Host ""Exiting CLI.""
Send-SSH exit
}
Write-Host ""Terminating Session.""
Remove-SshSession #Will send exit.</pre>
If I previously set the variable of rootlogin to 'true', then my I need an extra exit to get back to the shell prompt before my final exit closing the session.

This post is not intended to be an introduction to Powershell or scripting in general. There are better places for that. I just wanted to share an example of how you can use Powershell + SharpSSH to make your life a little easier. This script was written for Junos devices, however it could easily be modified for IOS devices, or any device for that matter.This example was a basic, single device, config backup script. I have some great snippets I will be sharing in future posts that can bolt on to make a more powerful script. 

If you want the entire script, including Joel's functions:
<pre>## USING the binaries from:
## http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sharpssh/SharpSSH-1.1.1.13.bin.zip
[void][reflection.assembly]::LoadFrom( (Resolve-Path ""D:\Scripts\Libraries\Tamir.SharpSSH.dll"") )

## NOTE: These are bare minimum functions, and only cover ssh, not scp or sftp
##?ÿ?ÿ?ÿ?ÿ?ÿ?ÿ also, if you ""expect"" something that doesn't get output, you'll be completely stuck.
##
## As a suggestion, the best way to handle the output is to ""expect"" your prompt,?ÿ and then do
## select-string matching on the output that was captured before the prompt.

Now you may ask why I created the if statement to check if I received the % prompt. If you're a Juniper engineer then you would know that % is the shell prompt you receive if you log in as root. I know I hard-coded sending the root username, but in future posts I will share a snippet that will allow for more dynamic entry of username/password combos, and if it happens to be the root user, then we would like to send CLI to start the CLI and enter operational mode. The Invoke-SSH function sends command 'cli' and expects the operational prompt &gt;. I used the variable to call the function because I didn't want it to write any output at this time so I capture it in the variable and sit on it. I also set a variable to true if logged in as root, for use later in the script.

Next I want to download the entire config for my backup folder:
<pre>#Invoke-SSH outputs the command(first line), the output, and the expected string line(EOF)
$a = Invoke-SSH ""show config | no-more"" '&gt;'
$a|out-file showconfig.txt
Write-Host ""Config Backup Complete.""</pre>
Here I use a variable to call the Invoke-SSH function and send the command ""show config | no-more"". Once the command is done executing we should be back at the operational mode prompt, therefore I expect &gt;. I then use out-file to write the variable to a text file, and write-host to display a little status message.

I then want to cleanly close out the session:
<pre>#Extra exit when logged in as root.
if ($rootlogin='true')
{
Write-Host ""Exiting CLI.""
Send-SSH exit
}
Write-Host ""Terminating Session.""
Remove-SshSession #Will send exit.</pre>
If I previously set the variable of rootlogin to 'true', then my I need an extra exit to get back to the shell prompt before my final exit closing the session.

This post is not intended to be an introduction to Powershell or scripting in general. There are better places for that. I just wanted to share an example of how you can use Powershell + SharpSSH to make your life a little easier. This script was written for Junos devices, however it could easily be modified for IOS devices, or any device for that matter.This example was a basic, single device, config backup script. I have some great snippets I will be sharing in future posts that can bolt on to make a more powerful script.

2/21/2012 20:18,Rethinking Scripting,"I recently wrote a post stating I was beginning learning scripting to aid in my network administration tasks. I had initially stated I was going to use Perl for this. Then I tried to write a script at work, but I'm not allowed to install unauthorized software on my machine, much less multiple machines or servers. We are also a Windows shop, so unfortunately no built-in scripting for me. Or so I thought. I overheard our Windows admin group talking about their Powershell scripts and this got me thinking. Can I use Powershell to write scripts for network device administration? It would make a great platform mostly because its authorized and it's built-in to Windows 7 and Server 2008. I started to do some research and one of the first things I came across was the use of the command line version of PuTTY called PLink to SSH into boxes and then pass commands. I started down this path, but it wasn't long before I began running into problems. Problems either passing commands through PLink or being unable to capture the entire output when running multiple commands. I had to find a better way.

I did some more research and discovered the use of a library called <a href=""http://huddledmasses.org/scriptable-ssh-from-powershell/"" target=""_blank"">SharpSSH in Powershell</a>. Now this is what I was looking for. In his post, Joel wrote a few Powershell functions using the SharpSSH library. All I have to do is store the DLLs some place and update the script with their location. The Invoke-SSH function he wrote closely mimics Expect scripts. You run a command and then 'expect' the prompt. This allows the function to know when the command is complete, something I was seriously hurting for using PLink.

I'm a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel, so what I did was take Joel's functions and use them in a manner that would benefit myself and maybe other network admins.?ÿLet me walk you through a quick script I wrote utilizing Joel's functions:

First I want to create my SSH session:
<pre>New-SshSession root 192.168.1.1 ## Will be prompted for password
if (Receive-SSH '%')
{
#root prompt
Write-Host ""Logged in as root. Starting CLI.""
$a = Invoke-SSH ""cli"" '&gt;'
$rootlogin = 'true'
}</pre>

Can I use Powershell to write scripts for network device administration? It would make a great platform mostly because its authorized and it's built-in to Windows 7 and Server 2008. I started to do some research and one of the first things I came across was the use of the command line version of PuTTY called PLink to SSH into boxes and then pass commands. I started down this path, but it wasn't long before I began running into problems. Problems either passing commands through PLink or being unable to capture the entire output when running multiple commands. I had to find a better way.

I did some more research and discovered the use of a library called <a href=""http://huddledmasses.org/scriptable-ssh-from-powershell/"" target=""_blank"">SharpSSH in Powershell</a>. Now this is what I was looking for. In his post, Joel wrote a few Powershell functions using the SharpSSH library. All I have to do is store the DLLs some place and update the script with their location. The Invoke-SSH function he wrote closely mimics Expect scripts. You run a command and then 'expect' the prompt. This allows the function to know when the command is complete, something I was seriously hurting for using PLink.

I'm a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel, so what I did was take Joel's functions and use them in a manner that would benefit myself and maybe other network admins.?ÿ Let me walk you through a quick script I wrote utilizing Joel's functions:

First I want to create my SSH session:
<pre>New-SshSession root 192.168.1.1 ## Will be prompted for password
if (Receive-SSH '%')
{
#root prompt
Write-Host ""Logged in as root. Starting CLI.""
$a = Invoke-SSH ""cli"" '&gt;'
$rootlogin = 'true'
}</pre>
Now you may ask why I created the if statement to check if I received the % prompt. If you're a Juniper engineer then you would know that % is the shell prompt you receive if you log in as root. I know I hard-coded sending the root username, but in future posts I will share a snippet that will allow for more dynamic entry of username/password combos, and if it happens to be the root user, then we would like to send CLI to start the CLI and enter operational mode. The Invoke-SSH function sends command 'cli' and expects the operational prompt &gt;. I used the variable to call the function because I didn't want it to write any output at this time so I capture it in the variable and sit on it.

Next I want to download the entire config for my backup folder:
<pre>#Invoke-SSH outputs the command(first line), the output, and the expected string line(EOF)
$a = Invoke-SSH ""show config | no-more"" '&gt;'
$a|out-file showconfig.txt
Write-Host ""Config Backup Complete.""</pre>
Here I use a variable to call the Invoke-SSH function and send the command ""show config | no-more"". Once the command is done executing we should be back at the operational mode prompt, therefore I expect &gt;. I then use out-file to write the variable to a text file, and write-host to display a little status message.",,

1/13/2012 14:26,Authenticating Cisco VoIP Phones via Dot1x,"If anyone has attempted to authenticate Cisco VoIP phones via Dot1x and Microsoft Network Policy Server then you know there are a few small issues. First the username that the phones send to the Radius server exceeds the length allowed by Windows. Secondly it is not a straightforward setup to get the phones to properly authenticate. 

First in Windows Server 2008, Microsoft removed support for EAP-MD5 authentication. However you can re-add this support to NPS by modifying the registry according to <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922574"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft KB922574</a>. 

Because phones are the exception to my normal radius policies, I used a separate Connection Request Policy for VOIP phones. I created one with the condition to match UserName = ""CP-*"". This should ensure that this policy only applies to Cisco phones(because all their usernames start with CP-*). 

Next we need to shorten the username which the phone sends so that we can match it to a valid Windows Domain Account. To do this we use the separate VOIP Connection Request Policy. Under Settings &gt; Attributes we need to override the Username attribute using a match and replace. For example we find ""CP-7975G-"" and replace with """". This will essentially remove the first part of the username and leave us with the ""SEP..."" username. A separate match will have to be configured for every model of Cisco phone which needs to be authenticated.

Finally we need to configure the authentication methods. Under Settings &gt; Authentication Methods we want to Override Network Policy Authentication Settings. We add the EAP Type ""MD5-Challenge"" and then check Encrypted Authentication (CHAP). This allows us to use a single Network Policy and override it when necessary using our VOIP Connection Request Policy. 

The only thing left to do is ensure that a Windows Domain Account is created and the Account Password is Stored using Reversible Encryption. Then enter the account password as the MD5 shared secret on the phone, turn Dot1x on the port and you're good to go. If you're using a Cisco switch, ensure you have dual-host authentication enabled so you can also authenticate a computer hanging off the phone.

If you need a little help troubleshooting NPS and can't find events in MS Event Viewer from CMD Prompt, Run As Admin, type: ""auditpol /set /subcategory:""Network Policy Server"" /success:enable /failure:enable"". NPS logs are in Event Viewer/CustomViews/Server Roles/Network Policy Server",,

12/20/2011 21:12,Perl - Reading from File,"In my <a href=""http://robertjuric.com/2011/12/18/perl-beginnings/"" title=""Perl?ÿBeginnings"" target=""_blank"">first attempt at Perl scripting</a> I wrote a short script to ping a host taken from a command-line argument. I now want to expound on that idea by pinging a list of hosts saved in a text file. To do this we simply open the text file as an array of lines and then use a ""for...each"" loop to ping each host individually. Each line contains a hidden newline character which has to be removed in order for the Net::Ping method to process the variable correctly. I attempted to use the Perl Chomp() function, however this was yielding strange results. After some experimentation I found an answer using my first foray into regular expressions (regex). Using the Perl search and replace regex function I was able to search the individual line for the newline character and replace it with nothing. I used a handy little tool, which you can find <a href=""http://www.regextester.com/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, to practice and see if my regex matched correctly on the newline character. 

Here is the script I ended up with:
<pre>
use Net::Ping;
use strict;
open(MYINPUTFILE, ""hosts.txt"");
my(@hosts) = &lt;MYINPUTFILE&gt;;
my($host);
foreach $host (@hosts) {
	$host =~ s/s+$//; #strip newline character from variable
	my $pingobj = Net::Ping-&gt;new('icmp');
	my ($status,$time,$ip) = $pingobj-&gt;ping($host);
	if ($status) {
		print ""Host $host ($ip) responded in $time secondsn"";
	} else {
		print ""Host $host ($ip) unreachablen"";
	}
}
close(MYINPUTFILE);
</pre>

And the results:

I created a hosts.txt file and put it alongside the script and for testing purposes I tried a few different formats for host entries as well as a ""null"" value to make sure the script was working as designed. I hope you can pick up where I am headed with this building block. This script will be the basis for more advanced scripts such as automating changes to multiple devices. ",,
12/18/2011 19:52,Perl Beginnings,"After reading some advice from some very smart people, I've decided to try my hand at learning a scripting language to aid in my network administration tasks. After some quick searching I've decided to learn Perl. From what I've gathered it has strong text manipulation capabilities which will come in handy parsing device configs or SNMP/SSH responses. I'm not going to attempt to teach programming basics, but what I hope to cover will be some useful examples and building blocks that we can use as network administrators. 

For my scripting setup I will be focusing on a Windows perspective. Instead of using <a href=""http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads"" target=""_blank"">ActivePerl</a> I decided to use <a href=""http://www.cygwin.com/"" target=""_blank"">Cygwin</a> and the Perl modules, so hopefully most of what I write will also apply to *nix users. I'm also using <a href=""http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" target=""_blank"">Notepad++</a> for my editing/coding, but you could also use the default Windows Notepad or if you want to be hardcore, Cygwin and VIM. I may include some VIM tips/shortcuts in future posts.

My first Perl script is not ""Hello, World"", but instead a simple Ping script. I used <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/Net/Ping.html"" target=""_blank"">Net::Ping</a> to conduct a simple ICMP Ping and then output the results. The example I first used had a hard-coded variable for the host, which I left commented out for reference purposes. Instead, I added a line to receive a command line argument for the host variable.

<pre>
use Net::Ping;
use strict;

#Setting a variable
#my $host = ""www.google.com"";

#Using an arguement
my $host = ""$ARGV[$0]"";
my $pingobj = Net::Ping-&gt;new('icmp');
my ($status,$time,$ip) = $pingobj-&gt;ping($host);

if ($status) {
print ""Host $host ($ip) responded in $time secondsn"";

11/22/2011 8:23,Working with IPv6 and Juniper SRX,"I finally decided that if I don??t run IPv6 then I am never truly going to understand it. I figured the best place to get started would be my own home. I didn??t want to completely get rid of my IPv4 network, I only wanted to try to get IPv6 up and running, so I decided to run a dual-stack. Since the computers are running Windows 7 and I have an SRX100 as our household firewall this proved not to be a problem. Also, it was only an after-thought, but apparently our wireless access point would pass the IPv6 traffic without any problems. My next problem was external IPv6 connectivity, what good would my private IPv6 network be if I couldn??t connect to any other IPv6 networks?

Enter Hurricane Electric and their free IPv6 tunnel broker service at <a href=""http://tunnelbroker.net/"" target=""_blank"">http://tunnelbroker.net/</a>. This is a free service that allows you to build a 6to4 tunnel to their network which then acts as your IPv6 gateway. 6to4 tunneling (RFC 3056 <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056"" target=""_blank"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056</a>) is an IPv6 transition mechanism which allows IPv6 packets to be encapsulated (aka tunneled) within IPv4 packets to a 6to4 gateway router which is then de-encapsulated and sent on to IPv6 networks. So I registered with HE using my external IPv4 address as the tunnel end-point and was assigned my tunnel endpoints as well as my very own routed /64 block of IPv6 addresses. I was also given an IPv6 DNS server to point to. It was finally time to get IPv6 up and running.

The first thing I needed to do was get my tunnel up and running. On my SRX100 this involved creating an IP tunnel interface, adding an IPv6 static route, and putting the SRX in packet-mode for IPv6 traffic.
<pre>
interfaces {
   ip-0/0/0 {
      unit 0 {
         tunnel {
            source 99.111.88.228;
            destination 216.66.22.2;
         }
         family inet6 {
            address 2001:470:7:e9e::2/64;
         }
      }
   }
}
routing-options {
   rib inet6.0 {
      static {
         route ::/0 next-hop 2001:470:7:e9e::1;
      }
   }
}
security {
   forwarding-options {
      family {
         inet6 {
            mode packet-based;
         }
      }
   }
}
</pre>
At that point I could see my tunnel was operational and I was able to ping the remote end of the tunnel. Next I needed to get IPv6 running internally. I decided to use Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) for address configuration. Devices running IPv6 will automatically configure for themselves a link-local address. This address is created using the FE80::/64 block + the EIU64 Interface ID. The EIU64 Interface ID is dynamically created using the Ethernet MAC address. The link-local address is required for basic IPv6 operations such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) which is used for SLAAC. Basically the link-local address allows for local communication of hosts without configuration in order to facilitate higher-level communications. One thing about link-local address are that they are not globally routable, which means that my computers with only a link-local IPv6 address would not be able to communicate with other IPv6 devices such as web servers.

I needed to use my /64 block of globally routable IPv6 addresses I was given and assign them to my hosts. To do this I needed to configure IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to allow my hosts to use SLAAC and auto-configure themselves an IPv6 address.
<pre>
interfaces {
   vlan {
      unit 0 {
         family inet {
            address 192.168.1.1/24;
         }
         family inet6 {
            address 2001:470:8:e9e::1/64;
         }
      }
   }
}
protocols {
   router-advertisement {
      interface vlan.0 {
         max-advertisement-interval 20;
         min-advertisement-interval 15;
         prefix 2001:470:8:e9e::/64;
      }
   }
}
</pre>
Now my hosts have both a link-local and a global IPv6 address and are able to ping through my tunnel. So far I haven??t done enough experimenting to get DHCPv6 working for DNS server assignment so I currently have my hosts DNS servers statically configured. I was then able to go online and check my IPv6 connectivity via <a href=""http://test-ipv6.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://test-ipv6.com/</a>.

Caveats:
Packet-based forwarding of IPv6 - Still researching the implications of this in regards to security
Had to use Junos 10.4R7.5 to assign family inet6 on vlan interfaces
Still have to experiment with DNS server assignment either through DHCPv6 or some other means
Lack of IPv6 websites/stuff to do

10/17/2011 20:44,SRX Firewall User Authentication,"Juniper SRX firewalls have a feature called Firewall User Authentication. FUA is another layer of protection on top of security policies to restrict/permit users or groups of users individually. FUA is a very limited feature but it could be used as a poor-man's NAC in a pinch. Users are authenticated via a single external source(RADIUS, LDAP, or SecureID) or the local database. FUA can operate in two different modes, Pass-Through Authentication, and Web Authentication.

Pass-Through Authentication is limited to Telnet, FTP, and HTTP traffic only(notice these are plain-text protocols). Pass-through auth works by interjecting a login challenge into the original protocol login challenge. For example a user would initiate a telnet connection, the FUA would interject and prompt the security challenge. Once authenticated, traffic from the same source IP is automatically allowed to pass through the SRX(could be dangerous with source NAT). This would allow the telnet connection to continue and the user can authenticate to the telnet host. Once the user has authenticated via FUA the IP address becomes exempt from further FUA requirements. This means that you can create a security policy that matches on ANY traffic type and require FUA; Pass-through authentication only works with Telnet, FTP, or HTTP, however once the IP/user has authenticated then it is exempt from further FUA, and it is then only bound by security policy. I said that to say this: you can use a telnet session to authenticate a user via FUA who, once authenticated, can pass any type of traffic which is allowed by the security policy.

Web Authentication operates in two sub-modes, standard web authentication, and web redirect. Standard web auth first requires you enable the HTTP system service, and also allow http in host-inbound-traffic. With standard web auth, you would direct your users to a secondary IP address of an interface on the SRX. Users would be prompted with an HTTP login form for the FUA. Once authenticated the IP address is added to the exempt list and is able to pass through the firewall as much as security policy allows. The web redirect operates like standard web auth, but you don't have to hand out an IP address of your firewall or direct users to a separate login page. Web redirect works much like what you're used to in a hotel room; You open your browser and head to Google.com, and you are automagically redirected to a login page. Once you authenticate you are able to pass through the firewall as much as security policy allows.

With all the authentication methods you are also able to configure a default timeout for inactivity and login/success/failure banners. Web redirect + a login banner would be a great poor-man option for a Guest Wireless NAC. You could hand out the username and password to guests, and they would be prompted with the Acceptable Use Policy before logging in.

<span style=""color:#ff0000;"">All FUA configuration follows the same basic principles: configure an access profile, configure the firewall authentication options, and finally call on the firewall authentication from security policy. (Good to know on an exam).</span>

Configure the access profile (local user database):

<pre>set access profile *profile-name* client *name* firewall-user password *pwd*</pre>

or (external authentication):

<pre>set access profile *profile-name* authentication-order [radius password]
set access profile *profile-name* radius-server *ip-address* secret *radius-secret*</pre>

Then configure the authentication type and options:

<pre>set access firewall-authentication pass-through default-profile *profile-name*
set access firewall-authentication pass-through [telnet/ftp/http] banner login ""You must login""</pre>

or

<pre>set interface *name* unit 0 family inet address *ip/mask* web-authentication http
set access firewall-authentication web-authentication default-profile *profile-name*
set access firewall-authentication web-authentication banner success ""Login successful""</pre>

Finally set a permit action of firewall-authentication in the security policy. For pass-through use: ""Permit firewall-authentication pass-through client-match *client-name*"". For web auth use: ""Permit firewall-authentication web-authentication client-match *client-name*"". For web redirect use the same as pass-through but add a web-redirect argument: ""Permit firewall-authentication pass-through web-redirect"".

And finally to verify:

<pre>show security firewall-authentication users
show security firewall-authentication history</pre>",,
9/29/2011 12:59,Security Policy and Address Groups,"I recently sat through a Juniper Security (JSEC) training course and learned something new about security policy regarding the objects that are able to be referenced in policy. When I got back to work I had a few rules I needed to add and some that needed to be removed so I thought it would be a good point to make the switch. I am talking about the use of address groups in security policy.?ÿBefore?ÿwe can reference a prefix in security policy it must be created as an address object. These address objects are stored in an address-book <em>per</em> security zone.?ÿ We can also create address-sets (Junos) and address groups (ScreenOS) which are basically groups consisting of individual address members. When we create a security policy, instead of creating a policy for each address entry, we can reference the address-set/address group to apply the policy to like entries. This allows us to change individual entries for a policy without directly affecting the policy.?ÿFor example, I have a group of 5 servers that need web access to download updates, but I don't want the entire zone to have Internet access. Instead of creating 5 individual policies I can create a single policy and refence an address-set/address group which consists of the 5 server address objects. In the future if I ever decide to give a new server Internet access or I need to remove Internet access for a server, I don't have to worry about cluttered policies, I can just add or remove an address to the address-set/address group.
<h2>Junos</h2>
We first need to create our address objects:
<pre>set security zones security-zone *ZoneName* address-book *AddressName* x.x.x.x/y</pre>
Then we need to create our address-set:
<pre>set security zones security-zone *ZoneName* address-book address-set *SetName* address *AddressName*</pre>
A few caveats, an address-set can only exist when there multiple addresses in the address-book. An address-set can only contain addresses from the same security zone, and also the address-set name cannot be the same as an existing address name.
<h2>ScreenOS</h2>
First create the address objects:
<pre>set address *ZoneName* *AddressName* x.x.x.x/y *Comment*</pre>
Then create the address group:
<pre>set group address *ZoneName* *GroupName* *Comment*
set group address *ZoneName* *GroupName* add *AddressName*</pre>
One thing I noticed?ÿin the Junos TechPubs was that?ÿwhen you reference an address-set in?ÿpolicy?ÿJunos creates an internal rule for each member, as well as each service. So if you create a policy which references an address-set for both source and destination and also a service group, Junos actually creates multiple internal rules. If you don't pay attention to the size of your groups you could exceed policy resources even though it appears you have a relatively small number of configured policies.

The?ÿmain point I want to?ÿconvey isn't necessarily how to configure address sets/groups, but to motivate you to use them. It's standard practice in the Windows AD realm where you rarely want to give an individual user rights to a server, it's much cleaner to give a security group rights to the server and then manage the membership of that group. This is particularly helpful if the same group will be referenced on multiple servers. The same concept applies to our firewall security policies.

So go forth and simplify your firewall rules...",,

4/6/2011 18:30,Why I'm Considering Quitting Twitter,"I have recently really let my Twitter participation fall by the waste side. This has left me feeling left out and somewhat out of touch. I really enjoyed Twitter because it was almost real time, and talking to other engineers as opposed to just reading white papers has been highly motivating. I would like to hear back from people to see if I'm totally off base or really justified. 

1. I can't keep up. I follow a little over 100 people and find it almost impossible, even when I give Twitter my full attention, to keep up with the really interesting conversations. I try to follow those who follow me, but I feel like it's getting out of hand. If I do decide to stay on Twitter I will have to do some serious pruning of e people I follow.

2. It is harder to stay connected at my new job. I started a new job this January that has a very high awareness of security. I'm unable to install unapproved software on my work desktop, and Twitter online is difficult to manage for serious twitter users. That leaves my cell phone for access, and trying to keep an eye on interesting tweets when I can only view 4 at a time is even more difficult.  Which leads me to my next point...

3. Twitter really is a distraction. As much as I do see a benefit in Twitter I have noticed an increase in productivity at work since my above point has forced me to limit my use. I'm not going to say Twitter use is a negative but I have seen how it's not quite a productivity multiplier. 

4. I also feel like I am now more motivated to use other forms of communication such as email, forums, and my blog. Keeping in mind my point number 3, I still need to be careful as forums and blogs can be just as distracting as my Twitter stream. I feel like I need to fill that social void that Twitter has left with other forms of communication.  I have really been working on some new articles I hope to publish soon.

So I'm considering either doing some serious trimming of who I follow, or just doing away with Twitter altogether. I am leaning toward the side of just calling it quits so I don't feel any temptation to dive head first back into my Twitter stream.

Thoughts, or good riddance?

2/24/2011 5:42,What is QFabric?,"Yesterday Juniper released another piece to the Project Stratus puzzle. Project Stratus is Juniper's attempt at a 3-2-1 process of flattening the data center hierarchy model. They introduced the new <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/switching/qfx-series/qfx3500/"">QFX3500 switch</a>, and the concept of <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/us/en/local/pdf/whitepapers/2000384-en.pdf"">QFabric</a>. As always, Twitter went crazy. I did enjoy the back and forth, it was educational listening to different perspectives from people much smarter than myself. A small debate broke out whether or not Juniper's QFabric was different from Cisco's FabricPath. I'm writing this article to hopefully entice some other opinions or blog replies. I'm sure not an expert, but I'm going to do my best to explain what I think the differences are. I'm not going to say one is better than the other, but to myself they do appear different.

<strong>Hardware</strong>

The QFX3500 is a 1U 48port 10GE switch, fully L2/L3 capable. This box seems similar to the Cisco Nexus 5548 switch. Not much to get excited about here, it was about time Juniper released something comparable.

Is there a major difference? I'm thinking no.

<strong>The Design, Stratus, QFabric</strong>

Project Stratus is supposed to consist of the QFX3500s linked back to a large chassis switch, which has yet to be released, using Juniper's new QSFP+ ports. This is supposed to yield an extension of the control plane(packets are processed once at ingress to the ""fabric""), and a single point of management. This concept sounds to me like how the Nexus 7000 can now support Nexus 2000s hanging off of it. I see two differences here: <del>1. Cisco does it with standard SFP+ ports</del>(I made the mistake of not researching the standard QSFP+ ports Juniper uses), and 2. The Nexus 2000 is little more than a dumb line-card and does not do any packet processing. I'm not sure if the method how the Stratus/QFX3500 or the Nexus 7k/2k uplink is much different(i.e. fex-fabric ports vs. Juniper's yet to be released config info), I plan on doing some more research into that.

Is there a major difference? I think a few small details, but the design is quite similar.

<strong>FabricPath = QFabric?</strong>

According to Cisco, FabricPath ""brings the stability and scalability of routing to Layer 2."" FabricPath is more of a L2 domain control innovation, or a stop-gap to TRILL/SPB, than a control plane extension. However, if you look at the FEX Fabric that links Nexus 5k&gt;2k or 7k&gt;2k, now that is a more accurate comparison to QFabric. With FEX Fabric and QFabric, the packet is processed once, and forwarded directly to it's destination. FabricPath still relies on multiple switch hops to operate. I think Juniper looks at from the view that if the network operates like one giant switch fabric, then there are no multiple hops and therefore no need for TRILL/SPB.

Is FabricPath = QFabric? I don't think so. But it does sound similar to Cisco's FEX Fabric.

<strong>Vaporware?</strong>

Yes. Juniper has only released the QFX3500 switch, which today can be used as a standard 10GE ToR switch. For Project Stratus to come together they still have to release their director chassis switch which will then use QFabric to interconnect the QFX3500s.

<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

First I'm a little disappointed in Juniper for being so vague. If I hadn't already talked to our Juniper reps about this release, I think I would be even more confused. Is QFabric similar to FabricPath? I still don't think so, but I'm open to being educated. Is QFabric revolutionary? At first I thought it was, but after seeing the Twitter-discussion, I'm not so sure now.

1/25/2011 11:49,10GE Killed the Hub,"I was talking to a fellow network engineer the other day showing off our new 10GE equipment and he made a comment how 10GE was a totally different technology than standard Ethernet because it did not use CSMA/CD. I acknowledged I didn't know what he was talking about and ran off to do some research, at which point I feel I fell into the Ethernet rabbit hole. I thought I would share my finding with you.

Let's get down and dirty with a quick overview of the base layers of the OSI model:

Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is compromised of both physical and data-link layer protocols that define the technology we network engineers all know and love. 

The data link layer consists of two sub-layers. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer. The MAC is a communication protocol sub-layer that provides addressing and channel access control mechanisms. In other words the MAC layer is pretty much our beloved 48-bit MAC addresses and CSMA/CD. MAC operates between the LLC sublayer and the physical layer to emulate full duplex communication. The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing so that muliple network protocols can coexist on the same media (such as IP &amp; IPX), and also provides flow control mechanisms. The LLC sub-layer acts as an interface between the MAC sublayer and the network layer.

Duplex is a method that two units communicate with each other in both directions. Half-duplex provides communication in both directions but only one direction at a time. Full duplex allows bi-directional communication simultaneously. Half-duplex can lead to collisions and re-transmissions (hence the need for CSMA/CD.) Full duplex allows communication simultaneously in both directions so there are no collisions. In full-duplex communication, a MAC layer is not necessary though it is still implemented for hardware addressing purposes. A hub is a good example of half-duplex communication.

Carrier Sense Multiple Acces (CSMA) is a MAC protocol in which a node verifies the absense of traffic before transmitting on a shared medium. CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a modification of CSMA that improves performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected. 

Flow Control is implemented in Ethernet with 802.1x when one station is sending traffic faster than the other 
station can receive it. When this happens a station sends a PAUSE command to a bridge group address and all data is stopped. On a side note: This messes with Classes of Service (802.1p) because all priorities are stopped. One of the new Data Center Bridging protocols, Priority Flow Control (802.1Qbb), attempts to address this issue by indicating pause time for each priority separately.

Now back to the original comment:
1000BASE-T supports autonegotiation of half-duplex communication when necessary. 10GE defines only full duplex links, so half-duplex and therefore CSMA/CD do not exist. The statement by my fellow engineer is correct, 10GE is missing CSMA/CD. However since Gigabit Ethernet, when operating in full duplex, doesn't utilize CSMA/CD either, I now consider it a bold statement that 10GE is totally different from standard Gig Ethernet. It could be said however that 10GE killed the hub!",,
1/24/2011 20:22,Introduction to ScreenOS,"I feel like I haven't written in a while but I've been going through a job transition. I finally feel like I'm starting to settle in and I thought I would share some of my new experiences learning about the Juniper Netscreen firewalls.

Unlike a majority of Juniper firewall users, I've had no experience with Netscreen firewalls. I was a little a little off-balance trying to pick up the SCREENOS commands, but once I got going on it I found they made logical sense and were similar to the JUNOS commands (sometimes).

My new job involves standing up a new development ""enclave"" network. When I arrived, a few others had turns unsuccessfully trying to make the network go, so my first task was to get the firewall passing traffic. I spent a few hours that night researching the basics of SCREENOS and the next day I was able to get the packets flowing.

SCREENOS CLI is very similar to to JUNOS in that it uses 'set' commands to make configuration changes. SCREENOS also differs greatly in that it uses 'get' commands to view config snippets.

<pre>get config
get interface
get policy</pre>
A few examples of the 'get' commands

I learned to imagine SCREENOS in layers. The foundation layer is the virtual-router, which closely resembles routing-instances in JUNOS. There are two system configured VRs: trust-vr and untrust-vr. The virtual routers are essentially routing table instances. The next layer is compromised of the security zones, which are by default assigned to the trust-vr virtual router. From here we need to step back and see how the Netscreen operates. It can operate in one of three modes, NAT mode, route mode, and transparent mode. I like to think of the 3rd layer of the Netscreen as the interfaces. When an interface is assigned to the Trust security zone it is by default configured in NAT mode, if you wish to configure straight routing you must explicitly configure it. Also, before you can assign an IP address to an interface, the interface must first be assigned to a security zone.?ÿ 

<pre>set int eth2/1 zone Trust
set int eth2/1 ip 10.10.1.1/30
set int eth2/1 route
set int eth1/1 zone Untrust
set int eth1/1 ip 10.10.2.1/30
</pre>

Now that we have our virtual router, security zones, and interfaces configured, the next layer consists of the routing and security policies which will allow the traffic to flow. The first thing we can do is configure a static default route:

<pre>set route 0.0.0.0/0 interface eth1/1 gateway 10.10.2.2</pre>

The next thing we need to do is configure a security policy to allow some traffic to flow through our security zones:

<pre>set policy from Trust to Untrust any any any permit</pre>
This policy consists of a source zone, destination zone, source object, destination object, and control action. More simply it reads: From zone Trust to zone Untrust and from any address to any address using any protocol then allow. Like JUNOS, SCREENOS uses address objects any time it references a specific IP or range of IPs in a security policy. For instance:
<pre>set address DMZ 192.168.75.1/32 ""Exchange""
set address Untrust 1.1.1.16/28 ""SmartHost""
set policy from Untrust to DMZ SmartHost Exchange smtp permit</pre>

That's pretty much the basics of getting the firewall to pass traffic. A quick note with the policies. If you do a 'get policy' it will list a policy id number next to each entry. You can then do 'unset policy id #' to remove policies. I just wanted to take a second to share with you my introduction to SCREENOS. I plan to write some more about it and the Netscreen firewalls as I spend more time working with them.",,
1/11/2011 8:26,New Year and New Beginnings,"I feel blessed to be kicking off 2011 with a fresh start at a new company. It's felt like a crazy few weeks going through the interview process and then the transition between companies. I thought I should take a minute to reflect back on the experience and share any insights I came across.
<ul>
	<li>Have a clean simple resume, and bring a copy with you to the interview. I brought a notebook (professional looking) with me to take notes of peoples names, responsibilities, and notes when considering a possible offer.</li>
	<li>Don't lie. If you're unfamiliar with a topic or technology, don't be afraid to say so. If you want to save face you could say, ""I'm not familiar with technology X, but I have experience with Y which is a similar technology."" However if you don't know something, you don't know something. It's not the end of the world.</li>
	<li>Have a bio for yourself. This is one I stumbled through and wish I was more prepared for. When asked, ""Tell me a little about your past experience"", you should have a well thought out answer. We all know what we've done at our past jobs, we wrote it down in our resumes, but did you rehearse speaking out loud a quick bio? It would be best to customize or tweak this bio to highlight your strengths that match with the opportunities' position requirements.</li>
	<li>Ask questions. If you're genuinely interested in an opportunity, I believe it will show in your curiosity to learn about the organization and the position requirements. A few things to consider include: the organizational structure of the company and more importantly the IT department, current coworkers that you would be working alongside with, and any future plans or projects in the works.</li>
</ul>
As always, be on time (better yet, a few minutes early), be professional (in both appearance and behavior), be yourself, and relax.",,

12/30/2010 17:08,2011 Predictions and Resolutions,"2010 is almost gone. It has been a good year with many new developments, but now it's time to start looking forward. So here is my $0.02 on what I think the new year will have in store for us:
<ul>
	<li>I predict we will see networking products become more tightly integrated with virtualization products such as VMware. Some companies are already starting to deliver products which integrate with vCenter, but I expect to see many more.</li>
	<li>TRILL/SPB will gain traction and we might possibly see it start to be implemented towards the end of the 2011.</li>
	<li>I'm going to step out there and say that FCoE won't gain much traction in 2011. I think protocols such as iSCSI or NFS will continue to improve, and we may see the development of a new protocol.</li>
	<li>Frame relay will continue to die a slow death at the hands of MPLS.</li>
</ul>
Any my personal resolutions for 2011:
<ul>
	<li>Get that CCNP and JNCIS. I'd like to have these completed by summer time so I can begin reading for my CCIE studies.</li>
	<li>Really understand MPLS.</li>
	<li>Make time for my family. I'm going to be having a baby in 2011 and I am going to make that my #1 priority.</li>
</ul>
Well I think that's it. Happy New Years Everyone!",,
12/24/2010 21:03,Optimizing e-Books for Kindle,"<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg""><img class=""alignleft size-large wp-image-356"" title=""Before"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/before.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""491"" height=""277"" /></a>

I've recently started uploading more technical documents to my Kindle for ease of access. But to compete with paper documents, I have to be able to access the information quickly. This means I rely heavily on the navigation built into the Kindle. I like to be able to jump straight to the Table of Contents, click on the chapter I want, or be able to quickly skip chapters. So what's wrong with this picture? This comes from a PDF e-book I purchased from CiscoPress and copied to my Kindle. There are 3 major things I have a problem with in this PDF. 1. There are no click-able links in the Table of Contents. 2. The Go To menu is missing an entry for the Table of Contents. 3. There are no tick marks to use the five-way controller for navigation. These are pretty major problems for me because it only allows me to read the document straight through, however I'd much rather be able to skip around through the book. Let's see if there is a better way to do this...

What we're going to do is convert the PDF to a PRC file. This will allow us to create the navigation that we want, but it will take a little extra leg work in order to properly apply the finishing touches.

1. First, Download and Install <a href=""http://www.mobipocket.com/en/DownloadSoft/ProductDetailsCreator.asp"" target=""_blank"">Mobipocket eBook Creator</a>

2. Import Your PDF for Conversion
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-360 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot006"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot006.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""472"" /></a></p>
<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot007.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-361 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot007"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot007.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""469"" /></a>Take note of the publication folder, our next step involves browsing the publication folder to find an image to use as the Cover image.

3. Locate and Set the Cover Image
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-369 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot008"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot0081.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""461"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-370 aligncenter"" title=""ScreenShot009"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot009.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""471"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">4. Next we have to edit the .HTML file so that we can find the HTML Anchor names to create our TOC item on the Go To menu.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-373"" title=""ScreenShot010"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot010.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""434"" /></a></p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here we can see that there is an anchor named ""link1"" designating the Contents page in the book. We'll now add this reference as a TOC Guide Item.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-374"" title=""ScreenShot011"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot011.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""470"" /></a>To create the link, we select the .HTML file by browsing for it, and then appending the HTML anchor of the Contents page. Next we need to save the project to create the .OPF Mobipocket project file.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">6. At this point we can either call it quits and build the .PRC file, or we can push forward and create a .NCX file so that we can use the five-way controller for navigation. I agree, let's move on and do this right.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Araby Greene wrote a great guest article <a href=""http://www.cjs-easy-as-pie.com/p/create-ncx-file-by-araby-greene.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> discussing the NCX file and it's use in-depth. I suggest you read the article and then come back for a high-level of what you need to add a NCX file to your project. Alright, now that you're back let's build our NCX file. You will have to go back to the original .HTML file we edited and search for more anchor names for each of the chapters, and also any other items such as preface, index, appendix, etc. that you may want to add. For my test example I used the Contents page, and Chapter 1 and 2:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-376"" title=""ScreenShot012"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot012.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""432"" /></a>The key items needed to create the navPoints are an id, the sequential playOrder (the order for the ticks), the text for the label, and the HTML link and anchor.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">Here is a building block example:</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE ncx PUBLIC ""-//NISO//DTD ncx 2005-1//EN"" 
  ""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx-2005-1.dtd""&gt;
&lt;ncx xmlns=""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/ncx/""  
  version=""2005-1"" xml:lang=""en-US""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:uid"" content=""uid""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:depth"" content=""1""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:totalPageCount"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;meta name=""dtb:maxPageNumber"" content=""0""/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;docTitle&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Title&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docTitle&gt;
&lt;docAuthor&gt;&lt;text&gt;Document Author&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/docAuthor&gt;
&lt;navMap&gt;
&lt;navPoint id=""uniqueID"" playOrder=""1""&gt;
&lt;navLabel&gt;&lt;text&gt;TextLabel&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/navLabel&gt;
&lt;content src=""link.html#anchor""/&gt;
&lt;/navPoint&gt;
&lt;/navMap&gt;
&lt;/ncx&gt;
</pre>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">7. Next, save this file as TOC.ncx and place it in the Publication folder.</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">8. Now we have to edit the .OPF project file to add insert a reference to the .NCX file:</p>
<p style=""text-align:left;"">The code to paste is:</p>

<pre>&lt;item id=""ncx"" media-type=""application/x-dtbncx+xml"" href=""toc.ncx""&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/manifest&gt;&lt;spine toc=""ncx""&gt;&lt;itemref idref=""item1""/&gt;&lt;/spine&gt;</pre>
You are essentially adding an item to the manifest and rewriting the spine.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-377"" title=""ScreenShot015"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/screenshot015.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""433"" /></a>9. Now we can save the .OPF and build the .PRC

10. We can download and install the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000234621"" target=""_blank"">Kindle Previewer</a> to open up the .PRC and verify the tick marks show up. Next we can copy the .PRC to the Kindle and enjoy an easily navigable reference document.

And voila...
<p style=""text-align:left;""><a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-378 aligncenter"" title=""After"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/after.jpg?w=1024"" alt="""" width=""478"" height=""270"" /></a>We now have click-able links in our Contents page, a shortcut to the Contents page in the Go To menu, and tick marks we can use to skip chapters using the five-way controller. A few caveats though: when importing the PDF into Mobipocket it might not create a link for every item in the table of contents. This could easily be fixed by modifying the .HTML file and adding anchors and links. I feel as long as I get the chapters linked I'm 80% happy. I also noticed that the 13.6mb PDF file I first started with turned into a 6.4mb PRC file.</p>
So if you are as detailed orientated as I am, you can now enjoy your tech docs in geeky bliss.

Merry Christmas!",,

12/21/2010 11:00,JUNOS - Security Policies,"As I have been continuing to setup our Juniper SRX firewalls I thought I would take a moment to discuss how to implement security policies in JUNOS. Before we get started I think it's important to cover a few quick concepts:
<ul>
	<li>Stateful Firewall - Monitors the state of network connection streams so that when traffic is inspected and permitted in one direction, the return traffic is also permitted.</li>
	<li>Zone-Based Firewall - Interfaces are arranged into groups called zones to build security boundaries</li>
	<li>JUNOS Security Policy Applications - Applications are a sort of profiles for apps which have defined protocol standards. Applications store information such as transport protocol, source and destination port numbers, and timeout values. These applications can be grouped into an Application-Set in order to simplify policy creation for multi-port applications. JUNOS has many predefined applications and also has the capability to define custom applications as needed. For more information, check out <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-security/junos-security10.0/junos-security-swconfig-security/policy-apps-understanding.html#policy-apps-understanding"" target=""_blank"">Juniper's documentation</a>.</li>
	<li>JUNOS Security Addresses - When building security policies, JUNOS relies on predefined addresses or address books which contain entries for either IP prefixes or FQDNs. Multiple addresses can be grouped together into an address-set to simplify policy creation for a group of address or prefixes.</li>
</ul>
JUNOS security policies are different from <a title=""JUNOS Firewall?ÿFilters"" href=""http://robertjuric.com/2010/09/19/junos-firewall-filters/"" target=""_blank"">firewall filters</a> in that security policies are stateful and applied to security zones, while firewall filters are stateless and applied directly to interfaces. Now let's get to it. The first thing we have to do is setup our security zones. A security zone is configured with 3 main components, the address-book, the interfaces, and host-inbound-traffic rules. The first two are pretty self-explanatory; host-inbound-traffic rules are configured to secure traffic originating from connected hosts within a zone. In other words, host-inbound-traffic rules are used to protect a zone from internal attacks. See <a href=""http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/junos-es/junos-es92/junos-es-swconfig-security/configuring-host-inbound-traffic.html"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for more information on configuring host-inbound-traffic.

Here is an example config for a trust and untrust zone:
<pre>set security zones security-zone trust address-book address mail01 dns-name mail01srv.domain.com
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address mail02 dns-name mail02srv.domain.com
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address-set mail_servers address mail01
set security zones security-zone trust address-book address-set mail_servers address mail02

</pre>
Now that we have our two zones configured, they are by default policy not permitted to pass any traffic. So we must configure policies to allow traffic to flow between the zones. Security policies work much like firewall filters in that they use a series of ""match...then"" statements which are applied to traffic in the order they are listed. A policy 'match' statement must specify a source-address, a destination-address, and an application. These specifications can be address-sets and application-sets respectively. A policy 'then' statement can contain either:
<ul>
	<li> Permit - Allows traffic to pass</li>
	<li> Deny - Denies traffic to pass by *silently* dropping the packet</li>
	<li> Reject - Denies traffic to pass by dropping the packet, but also sends an ICMP Port Unreachable reply for every dropped packet</li>
	<li> Log - An option to enable logging of the sessions, requires the creation of a logfile via ""set system syslog file &lt;file-name&gt; &lt;options&gt; ""</li>
	<li> Count - An option to enable counting (in bytes or kilobytes) of all traffic permitted by the policy</li>
</ul>
Here is an example of a few policies which will first allow SMTP traffic from my mail servers, then block SMTP from any host, and finally all any traffic:
<pre>set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match source-address mail_servers
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp match application junos-smtp
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy allow-smtp then permit

set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp match application junos-smtp
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp then deny
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy block-smtp then log session-init session-close

set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow match application any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone untrust policy internet-allow then permit
</pre>
It is important to take note of the policy ordering. Security policies are applied in order. If my internet-allow policy were at the top of the list, it would make my SMTP filtering policies useless. I could fix this easily this with the command:
<pre>insert policy &lt;name&gt;  {before/after} policy &lt;name&gt;</pre>
That gives you the basic run-down to configure security policies in JUNOS. I would recommend reading the documentation when it comes planning time so that you can properly configure the correct features for your requirements.",,

11/9/2010 13:58,IOS - VLAN Access Lists,"So we all know how to filter traffic as it passes between VLANs or between L3 interfaces using standard ACLs. But what do we do about filtering traffic withing a VLAN? Say we want to isolate a single host by disallowing it to communicate with other hosts in the same subnet? Step in the VACL. The switch TCAM performs the VACL matching and action as packets are switched within the VLAN or routed to a different VLAN. There is no need to specify inbound or outbound direction. VACLs are configured as VLAN access maps much like a route map. 

You first have to configure the VACL:
<pre>Switch(config)# vlan access-map &lt;map-name&gt; [sequence-number]</pre>
The access-maps are processed in sequence-number order. You are able to have multiple matching conditions followed by an action.
<pre>Switch(config-access-map)# match ip address {acl-number | acl-name}
Switch(config-access-map)# match mac address &lt;acl-name&gt;
Switch(config-access-map)# action {drop | forward | capture} | redirect &lt;port&gt;}</pre>

The next step is to apply the VACL to the VLAN:
<pre>Switch(config)# vlan filter &lt;map-name&gt; vlan-list &lt;vlan-list&gt;</pre>
You are able to apply the VACL to multiple VLANs using the vlan-list.

This has been a quick and dirty look at VACLs, another tool for your toolbox.",,

11/2/2010 12:07,Twinax/DAC Cable Differences,"I am currently in the process of implementing Juniper EX4500 switches to deliver 10GE connectivity to our ESX host servers. During this process we decided to go the route of direct attach copper (DAC) cables to save money. We dug around what little research we could find and eventually decided to purchase Brocade converged network adapters (CNAs) to install in our servers. When we finally got around to mocking up this setup in our lab this week we ran into a major issue. I was unable to get the physical link between the server and the switch to come up. We swapped out the cable to try this Brocade DAC cable we just happened to have laying around and the link came right up. That was interesting, so we started doing a little research...

Are all DAC cables created equally? The answer is no. There are two types of DAC cables: Active and Passive. Scientific Computer has a <a href=""http://www.scientificcomputing.com/High-speed-Copper-Interconnects-Address-Critical-HPCHurdles.aspx"" target=""_blank"">good article</a> listing the differences between active and passive cables.

<a href=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-286"" title=""DAC Cables"" src=""http://robertj.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/2010-11-02_12-28-36_491.jpg?w=300"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"" /></a>You can see here three different cables. The one on the left is the Brocade active cable. The middle is the Juniper passive cable, and the one on the right is a Cisco passive cable. You can see the contact pad difference between the active and passive cables.

What does this mean to us network engineers? Vendor support. Not every vendor supports both passive and active cables, while some vendors require active cables. Take our situation for example: Juniper does not currently support active DAC cables, however the Brocade CNAs we purchased will only work with an active cable. This put us in a tight spot. Take this opportunity to learn from our mistake, check with your vendors regarding passive/active cable support if you are planning on implementing 10GE direct-attach copper cables.",,

Say what? Martians? Aliens? Ok ok, I know it's corny but I learned something new today and it made me grin.

So it turns out Martian addresses are not how you get a letter to Mars, instead they are network addresses for which JUNOS decides to ignore all routing information. These addresses are never added to the routing table, and usually are only present by misconfiguration/mistake.

The IPv4 addresses which are by default considered Martian addresses are:
<ul>
	<li>0.0.0.0/8</li>
	<li>127.0.0.0/8</li>
	<li>128.0.0.0/16</li>
	<li>191.255.0.0/16</li>
	<li>192.0.0.0/24</li>
	<li>223.255.255.0/24</li>
	<li>240.0.0.0/4</li>
</ul>
In IPv6:
<ul>
	<li>Loopback address (::1)</li>
	<li>Reserved and unassigned prefixes from <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt"" target=""_blank"">RFC 2373</a> (which apparently has been obsoleted by <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4291.txt"" target=""_blank"">RFC 4291</a>)</li>
	<li>Link-local unicast prefix (fe80::/100)</li>
</ul>
You can also add additional prefixes to the list of Martian addresses by setting prefix lists in the <code>[edit routing-options martians]</code> hierarchy. You are able to specify the prefix, bit mask, and a match type. The match types you can choose from are:
<ul>
	<li>exact</li>
	<li>longer</li>
	<li>orlonger</li>
	<li>prefix-length-range</li>
	<li>through</li>
	<li>upto</li>
</ul>
You can also specify the <code>allow</code> command to remove a prefix from the Martian address list.

Some examples:
<pre><code>
[edit routing-options]
root@Router# set martians 31/8 orlonger
root@Router# set martians 240/4 orlonger allow

Thought I'd share a little good news... I took my JNCIA-EX exam today, and I passed! The Juniper exam seems to be a little more JUNOS orientated instead of the networking fundamentals that the CCNA containted. There were no subnetting questions, and the exam almost assumes a prior knowledge of the networking basics (though the O'Reilly JUNOS Ent. Switching book does cover the basics). 

Overall I'd say it was a good exam and I look forward to starting my study for the JNCIS-ENT.",,
9/29/2010 19:07,Hands on Hardware - Juniper,"
So we've recently decided to consolidate our two existing data centers into a single data center and move them to an off-site co-location. Part of this new project involved redesigning our data center network. Let me tell you, know is an exciting time to be building a new data center. We looked at Cisco, Juniper, and Brocade to get their proposals for our new data center. Brocade at the time did not have a 10GE top-of-rack switch. Cisco, with their Nexus line looked like a solid option, though the missing L3 functionality in the 5020 pushed us away. In the end, Juniper had a solid offering at a competitive price. There was some hesitation moving away from an all Cisco network, though in the end we are pleased with our decision.

Our design consists of SRX650s for our edge, EX4500s in the top-of-rack, and also EX4500s for our core. We debated what to put in the core, but with our small footprint (we're looking at two racks once we are more virtualized) we decided that the EX4500s would suffice. There will also be some 4200s and 2200s for some other peripheral uses.

Well we cut POs, and the blue boxes have started to show up. I thought I'd share some pictures I took while I was inventorying and assembling the devices and modules.

9/26/2010 19:51,JUNOS VLANs and Trunking,"Today, I'm going to give a quick introduction to VLANs and trunking in JUNOS. VLANs in JUNOS work almost opposite like they do in IOS. You first create a VLAN with a vlan-name and then you assign a vlan-id (dot1q tag). By default all switch-ports are assigned to the 'default' vlan which is untagged (no vlan-id is assigned). 

To create a VLAN:
<pre><code>set vlans &lt;vlan-name&gt; vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre>

You then assign interfaces to a VLAN individually:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
vlan members &lt;vlan-name&gt;</code></pre>

Fairly straight-forward right? Now on to trunking, which differs a good bit from what we are used to with IOS. By default, JUNOS does not specify a native-vlan. Trunks, by default, do not support any (allow) any VLANs. Trunks also do no auto-negotiate by default. 

To set an interface as a trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching 
port-mode trunk</code></pre>
You can then either explicitly allow individual VLANs, or you can allow all VLANs on the trunk:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
vlan members all</code></pre>

If you would like to trunk to a Cisco device, you must first create a ""native"" vlan (it would help to name it 'native') with a vlan-id of 1 (unless you've changed the native-vlan on the Cisco device). You can then specify the native-vlan on the trunk interface:
<pre><code>set interfaces &lt;interface-name&gt; unit 0 family ethernet-switching
native-vlan-id &lt;#&gt;</code></pre> 

I know that this does not appear to be a very easy way of assigning interfaces to VLANs, but at this point in my study it's all that I've got. I am going to do some more research into this, as I'm sure there is a more efficient way of doing things. ",,
9/22/2010 13:02,JUNOS Firewall Filters - Part 2,"As promised I'm following up with my <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/junos-firewall-filters/"">previous post</a> regarding firewall filters and writing about implementing firewall filters. 

A brief recap: there are 3 different types of firewall filters available in JUNOS: port, vlan, and router (layer3). These are configured under the appropriate family (inet or ethernet-switching) in the FIREWALL hierarchy. The filters contain terms (up to 2048 of them) which are built like if/then statements which contain match conditions (the <i>if</i> part) and actions (the <i>then</i> part). Now let's get to it.

<b>Applying Port Filters:</b>
<pre>interfaces {
   &lt;interface name&gt; {
      unit 0 {
         family ethernet-switching {
            filter input &lt;filtername&gt;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>
Notice that, as mentioned in my previous post, port filters are only able to be applied to ingress traffic on L2 interfaces.

<b>Applying Router (Layer 3) Filters:</b>
<pre>interfaces {
   &lt;interface name&gt; {
      unit 0 {
         family inet {
            filter &#91;input/ouput&#93; &lt;filtername&gt;
         }
      }
   }
}</pre>
Note here the option to filter on ingress or egress traffic of the L3 interface. It's also the same setup as a Port filter, but applied at the <i>inet</i> family instead of <i>ethernet-switching</i>.

<b>Applying VLAN Filters:</b>
<pre>vlans {
   &lt;vlan name&gt; {
      filter &#91;input/ouput&#93; &lt;filtername&gt;
   }
}</pre>

A quick word on processing order, when processing Layer 2 packets(switched), the firewall filters are applied in this order:
1. Ingress Port
2. Ingress VLAN
3. Egress VLAN

When processing Layer 3 packets (routed), the firewall filters are applied in this order:
1. Ingress Port
2. Ingress VLAN
3. Ingress Router
4. Egress Router
5. Egress VLAN

I failed to mention this in my previous post, but if you're unhappy with how the terms are arranged in a filter, (since they are processed in order) you can simply re-arrange them instead of rewriting the entire filter:
<pre>
&#91;edit firewall filter family inet filter dummyfilter&#93;
root@switch# insert term &lt;term1&gt; before term &lt;term2&gt;
</pre>

Well that wraps it up for firewall filters. I sit for the JNCIA-EX exam next week, so you can expect to see a handful of basic switching posts coming soon.",,
9/19/2010 20:41,JUNOS Firewall Filters,"<br>They're called ACLs or Access Control Lists in IOS, but in JUNOS they're called firewall filters. While they appear more complex than a simple ACL line, they do offer much more control and granularity over the commands. JUNOS has 3 different type of firewall filters: port (layer 2) filters, vlan filters, and router (layer 3) filters. Port firewall filters are applied to layer 2 switch ports, only in the ingress direction. VLAN firewall filters can be applied to both ingress and egress directions on a VLAN. Router firewall filters can be applied to the ingress or egress directions on layer 3 interfaces and RVIs (routed vlan interfaces), they can also be applied to the ingress direction on a loopback interface. 

Like IOS, you must configure the firewall filter and then apply it at the correct level. You are only able to apply one firewall filter per port/vlan/router interface, per direction. However the filter is able to support up to 2,048 terms. The firewall filter syntax is as follows:
<pre><code>
firewall {
   family &#91;inet/ethernet-switching&#93; {
      filter &lt;filtername&gt; {
         term &lt;termname&gt; {
            from {
               &lt;match conditions&gt;
            }
            then {
               &lt;action&gt;
            }
         }
      }
   }
}</code></pre>
<br><br>
You can check out <a href=""http://jnpr.net/techpubs/en_US/junos/topics/reference/requirements/firewall-filter-ex-series-match-conditions.html"">this link from Juniper</a> for a nice list of match conditions and actions. As you can see in the link, there are terminating actions and modifying actions.

To match multiple conditions within a term you can use logical AND/OR statements. If the term contains common match statements (such as multiple protocols), it is treated as a logical OR statement. Uncommon match statements are as treated logical AND statements. For example:
<pre><code>
from {
   protocol [tcp udp];
   source-port 123;
}</code></pre>
In this example, the protocol match statement is treated like a logical OR statement, while the combination protocol/source-port  is treated as a logical AND statement.

As a packet is processed through the filter, it is processed by each term in order. If there is a match in a term, and a terminating action is specified, no other terms are processed. If there is an action modifier, but no terminating action, it will default to the action of <i>accept</i>. If there is no match on the filter, the packet is discarded (implicit discard). 

That should be a quick overview of firewall filters in JUNOS. I will pick up next time with applying firewall filters.",,
9/11/2010 20:47,JUNOS User Configuration,"Continuing with my Juniper posts, I was going to write a larger post covering a few topics but once I got started writing I realized how large a post this grew to be. So with this post I will only cover some basic user setup to get you started using a Juniper device.

Before you can complete your first commit on a Juniper device you must set a root user password. You can use the following command to set the root users password: <code>set system root-authentication plain-text-password.</code> You will then be prompted to enter and confirm the password. It is important to note that the root user is the only predefined user on JUNOS, and this user also can only log in via the console and SSH, the root user is not allowed to telnet to the device.

After configuring the root user you may want to create individual user accounts. The process to do this is fairly simple, you create the user, assign it to a user class, and then set a local password. The user class defines the privilege and access level. JUNOS includes 3 predefined user classes: <em>operator</em> which allows clear, network, reset, trace, and view commands,<em> read-only</em> which allows for view commands, and <em>super-user</em> which allows all commands. If you need more granular control, you can create custom user classes. To create a new user account you can use the following command: <code>set system login user &lt;username&gt; class &lt;user-class&gt; authentication plaint-text-password.</code> You will then be prompted to enter and confirm the password. (I know I'm skipping RADIUS and TACACS, but I will come back to those later.)

If you happen to forget or need to reset the root password this is a pretty simple process. You need to console to the device and reboot it. Pay attention to look for the prompt to press [Spacebar] for a command prompt. Press the space bar and the boot process will be interrupted and you will be given a <code>loader&gt;</code> prompt. Type <code>boot -s</code> to enter single-user mode. Once it finishes loading type <code>recovery</code> and you will finally arrive at the CLI. From here you can enter config mode, set the root-authentication password again, commit the change, and then reboot the switch with the <code>request system reboot</code> command.",,
9/2/2010 20:48,JNCIA-EX / Junos Overview,"I've decided to take a break from my CCNP studies to pursue the JNCIA-EX certification. I've scheduled my exam for the end of September, so I've got some serious studying to do. I decided that an overview of Juniper's Junos CLI would be a good first Juniper blog post.

<strong>CLI</strong>
JUNOS runs on a modified BSD kernel, and because of this when you first log into a device as root you are at the BSD shell. Like Cisco there are different CLI prompt symbols to let you know what level you are at. '%' Specifies the BSD shell. From the BSD shell you can run the command 'cli' to start the Junos CLI in Operational Mode, where you will receive the '&gt;' prompt symbol. From op mode you can type 'configure' to enter Configuration Mode where you will see the '#' prompt symbol. Most of the commands available in operational mode include the 'show' commands, as well as ping, traceroute, telnet, and ssh. To run an operational mode command in config mode you simply preface the command with 'run'. Unlike Cisco's IOS 'do' command, Juniper's JUNOS 'run' command can be used in any config mode context.

<strong>Configs</strong>
The JUNOS config uses a hierarchical design much like XML. Throughout the hierarchy you?ÿ can use 'set', 'delete', or 'rename' to modify config parameters. With JUNOS, unlike IOS, when you enter configuration mode your changes do not take immediate effect. Instead, when you enter configuration mode, you are given a candidate configuration. The candidate configuration is an exact copy of the active configuration, but allows you to make changes without affecting the active configuration. After changes have been made to the candidate config, and you wish to apply the changes to the active config you must save the changes with the 'commit' command. JUNOS also has a rollback configuration which is automatically updated with each commit. JUNOS stores the 50 most recent configs directly on the device, rollback 0 (the active config) and 49 saved rollback configs.

So for a little recap, the device is running the Active configuration. When you enter config mode, you are give a Candidate configuration. After you save the changes with the 'commit' command, the candidate configuration becomes current Active configuration. The previous active configuration becomes Rollback 1, and all the other rollback configs increment down the line. Rollback configs 1-3 are stored on the device in /config/. Rollback configs 4-49 are stored in /var/db/config/.

If you mess up working on the candidate config and want to start again with a fresh candidate config you can use the command 'rollback 0'. If you decide you need to roll back your active config you are able to load any of the 49 stored rollback configs with the command 'rollback <em>n</em>'.

If you want to save a snippet of config you can use the 'save' command. The save command only works at the current config hierarchy, so if you want to save the entire config, you need to make sure you're at the top of the config. This saved config is stored in the user's home directory on the device, unless a remote FTP or SCP server is specified.

If you want to load a snippet you have two options, you can use 'load override' or 'load merge'. 'Load override' will replace the candidate configuration with the loaded config. 'Load merge' will add the loaded config snippet to the candidate configuration without replacing anything. If you want to paste a config snippet through the terminal you can use 'load merge terminal' command and then paste the snippet. If you have a snippet that includes the set commands you will have to use 'load set terminal'.",,
8/17/2010 21:37,OSPF Overview Notes,"Summary:
Routers form neighbors and send LSAs (link state announcements). As a router receives LSAs, it uses them to build the LSDB (link state database), applies SPF algorithm to LSDB to select the best routes to populate the routing table.

1. Neighbor discovery
Multicast hellos sent to 224.0.0.5 for neighbor discovery
Must meet requirements:
Same subnet
Hello/dead intervals match
Ip mtu match
Pass authentication
Unique router ids
If routers meet requirements they move to the 2-way state and are then able to move forward with topology exchange. Hellos continue to be sent to monitor responsiveness.

2. Topology exchange
After neighbors form, they exchange LSA headers via DD (database description) messages. The DD messages allow the router to learn what it does not know so that it can request only the complete LSAs it needs. For missing LSAs the router sends a LSR (link state request) which is replied with by a LSU (link state update) and then acknowledged by a LSAck (link state acknowledgement). When all LSAs have been exchanged and both routers have identical LSDBs, they move to the fully adjacent state.

When a DR (designated router) exists, all routers exchange databases only with the DR via a Type 2 LSA psuedo node. DROther (non-dr) nodes send updates to multicast 224.0.0.6 which are processed only by the DR and BDR. Essentially all DROther routers exchange databases only with the DR which then relays back to the rest of the DROthers. This is why only neighborships with the DR will be FULL while neighborships between DROthers remain in a 2-way state.

3. Route selection
Router searches LSDB to find all possible routes to a destination. For each route, the router adds up OSPF interface costs for all outgoing interfaces. The router will then pick the route with the lowest total cost and add the route to the routing table.",,

7/1/2010 10:19,Data Center Move,"I was trying to think of my next blog post and I was running out of ideas when it hit me that we're moving data centers! Not only are we moving data centers, we are collapsing two data centers into a single data center through virtualization. We are also spinning off a division of our company as a standalone entity with it's own infrastructure.

To bring you up to speed, we are breaking this into 4 large projects: 1. Setting up the new data center infrastructure for both companies. 2. Moving the spin-off company to their new data center. 3. Collapsing/moving the Southern data center to the new data center, and then finally 4. Moving the main data center. We currently have about 70 physical servers and 70 virtual servers. We are a VMWare shop and plan on either P2V'ing the physical servers or just rebuilding them as virtual and migrating data, when all is said and one we are expecting to have around 200-250 virtual machines and are not expecting to run into any machines that we can't virtualize.

We started out with the idea of building out our own data center, but when we got down to engineering it out at our location, cooling costs were going to blow our budget. Also, because we are a relatively small IT department we weren't too excited about having to manage the cooling, power, generators, etc. which eventually led us to look for hosted racks at a larger provider.

So far we have been spending most of this year researching vendors and trying to design our brand-new data center. We have been researching SANs, switches, backup solutions, VMWare, servers. So much stuff in such a short period of time that my head hurts at times. But what a great learning experience, one that I hope to share with you as we progress through this project.",,
6/22/2010 20:30,HWIC-3G-CDMA-V Notes,"I deployed our first 3G enabled router on the Verizon network last week. Configuring the CDMA HWIC is similar to configuring the GSM, except for the fact that I had to activate the modem first. With the GSM HWIC I was able to insert an already active SIM card and start running. The CDMA does not use a SIM card and has to use either OTA (Over The Air) or manual activation. To activate the CDMA modem I first ran a '<em>show cellular 0/0/0 radio</em>' to verify I had a signal and <em>'show cellular 0/0/0 network'</em> to discover the SID (SystemID) and the NID (NetworkID) of the network.?ÿ The command to perform manual activation is:

<em>cellular slot/wic_slot/port cdma  activate manual mdn msid sid nid msl</em>

For the MDN and MSDIN I used the 10 digit telephone number. The SID and NID can be found in the show radio command and for the MSL I just used '0'.

Once activation was complete I was ready to roll. One thing I noticed was when I tried to run the chat script to reduce network attach time, the script failed out. I have not had any problems with network attach times with this CDMA HWIC. Also, because of my newly learned EasyVPN skills, no static IP addresses or static IP tunnels were necessary to get this site online. I have to say coupled with EasyVPN, this is starting to become a more easily deploy-able solution. I hope that the 3G technology can meet our business needs, as it would provide much greater flexibility

Edit/Update 7/27/2010:

I just attempted to activate another HWIC-3G-CDMA-V, but on a new IOS version, and I found out the command has changed somewhat. I was running Adv. Security 15.0(1)M2. The command was:

<em>cellular 0/0/0 activate manual mdn msid msl</em>

Again the MDN and the MSID are basically the 10-digit mobile number number and I used '0' for the Verizon MSL.",,

Let's look at this from bottom to the top:

Layer 1 of the OSI Model gives us 10GE or 10 Gigabit Ethernet. 10GE is standardized as IEEE 802.3-2008 which covers the various physical layer flavors such as 10GBASE-SR.

Layer 2 defines our Data Link protocols such as FiberChannel and Ethernet; we'll focus on the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet has been stretched out to cover many various enhancements under IEEE 802.1. In the converged data center network there is a demand for improvements over our standard ""lossy"" Ethernet. This is where DCB, or Data Center Bridging, comes into play. DCB is a collection of enhancements to the 802.1 Ethernet standard that can transform Ethernet to ""lossless"". These enhancements include 802.1Qau, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. Fore more information on these enhancements check out the<a href=""http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/dcbridges.html"" target=""_blank""> IEEE DCB Task Group</a>. DCB is the term for these enhancements used by the IEEE. DCE, or Data Center Ethernet, is Cisco's trademarked term based on these enhancements. CEE, or Converged Enhanced Ethernet, is trademarked by IBM and used by companies such as Juniper. I think it is important to note that while all of these terms mean the same thing, none have been ratified as a standard.

Layer 3 is where FCoE, or Fiber Channel over Ethernet, calls home. FCoE is the encapsulation of Fiber Channel frames into Ethernet frames. Because Fiber Channel is a loss-less protocol it requires the enhancements to Ethernet as found in DCB. One important item to note is that because FCoE lives at Layer 3 it is not able to route across IP networks.

I threw iSCSI in there where it lives in Layer 5 so that you can see how iSCSI traffic is able to route across our IP networks. Hopefully seeing this drawn out based on OSI layers can give you a better grasp of the technologies and their buzzwords.

I've been preparing mostly by reading, practicing subnetting, and practicing on the exam simulator. I went yesterday morning to take my exam... and passed!! I'm now a full CCNA! I am still excited and I feel like I have had a large burden taken off my shoulders.

I thought I would share a few quick tips, or at least things that helped me study:
<ul>
	<li>Subnetting - Practice, Practice, Practice
I study subnetting in two ways: memorizing my chart and then practicing to find the subnet address. For the ICND2 or CCNA exam, I would recommend adding the wildcard masks as a column to remember, it might come in handy. I practiced writing my chart top to bottom, left to right, and then backwards just to make sure I knew it. I timed myself a few days before the exam to see how long it took me to copy the entire chart /20 - /30, it only took me about 2 minutes. That makes it well worth it to write down the chart once the exam begins to have as a reference later.
I also practiced subnetting by practicing finding the subnet address and the range for that subnet. I found a great site online that provides random practice problems <a href=""http://faculty.valleycollege.net/rpowell/jscript/subnet2.htm"">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Exam Simulator
I also spent a good bit of time on the exam simulator trying to answer the study questions. Honestly as I was using the exam simulator I didn't do as well as I had hoped and was nervous about taking my real exam. However, the questions on the actual exam seemed to be a little easier, so after taking the exam I felt exam simulator did a great job of helping me to prepare.</li>
	<li>Real-World Experience
I have to say real-world experience is invaluable on the exam. I had already configured VLANs and ACLs and spent some time with STP so I felt comfortable with those questions. The company I work for utilizes a MPLS network and we only have a few legacy frame relay circuits still alive, so those questions seemed to prove the most difficult for me.</li>
</ul>
I would like to encourage anyone else wanting to take CCNA exam to go ahead and schedule the exam, study hard, and just do it.",,
3/1/2010 20:44,HWIC-3G-GSM - Network Attach Time,"As of last week I now have two 3G cellular enabled routers running two different plants. One painful issue we experienced with our first installation was the long network attach time, or the time for the HWIC to get a signal. In the case of a power outage, or router reload, the time for the card to find a signal again was painfully slow. After a few incidents and much research I finally found in the Cisco documentation stating for North American installs you should run a one-time CHAT script to narrow the network search range to North American Bands only. I experimented with this CHAT script on my second install and saw a major improvement. I then went back and ran the script on my first installation with the same results. I feel that it is safe now to add to my list of documentation.

For the initial configuration notes see my original post <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/hwic-3g-gsm/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

<em>(config#) chat-script prl """" ""at"" TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" AT!ENTERCND=""A710"" TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" AT!CUSTOM=""PRLREGION"",02 TIMEOUT 5 ""OK"" ""AT!RESET""</em>

<em>(config#) int cellular 0/0/0
(config-if#) shutdown
(config-if#) exit</em>

<em>(config#) debug chat</em>

<em>(config#) start-chat prl 0/0/0</em>

<em>(config#) int cellular 0/0/0
(config-if#) no shutdown
(config-if#) exit</em>

The first part of this snippet creates the script. We then shut down the cellular interface. Turn on CHAT debugging so we can verify that the script is applied successfully. Run the script, and after verification, bring the interface back up. Be sure to do a <em>'no debug all' </em>to turn off debugging.

2/12/2010 19:45,STP Configuration,"This is a brief overview of the commands necessary to properly setup STP

1. Set STP Mode
<em>(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst</em>

2. Influence STP Topology - Specify Root and Secondary Switches
<em>(config)# spanning-tree vlan </em><em>vlan-id root primary</em>
Tells the switch to use pick a priority value, for the specified VLAN, that will force the switch to become the root switch. The same command can be given as 'root secondary' to specify the backup switch. You can also use <em>spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt; priority &lt;#&gt; </em>command to modify the base priority, however it is preferred to specify the root switch.

3. Influence STP Topology - Influence RP Selection
If you have two links to the root switch, port cost will decide which becomes the root port. Since port cost is by default based on bandwidth, when there is a tie it is decided by the lowest MAC address. You can influence this decision by manually lowering the port cost on the port you would like to be used as the root port:
<em>(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt; cost &lt;#&gt;</em>

*When setting the root switch or port costs you can either use the 'vlan <em>vlan-id</em>' command or omit it and apply the changes to all VLANs.

4. Enable Other Features
On switch ports that will only be used as access ports it is best to configure PortFast and BPDU Guard:
<em>(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
(config-if)# spanning-tree bpdu guard enable
</em>You can<em> </em>also specify BPDU guard to be on by default any time PortFast is enabled with the global command:
<em>(config)# spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default</em>
When BPDU guard finds a problem it will disable the port until you manually reset it. To have the port reenable itself use errdisable recovery:
<em>(config)# errdisable recovery cause bpduguard</em>
The default timeout is 300 seconds, you can modify this setting with:
<em>(config)# errdisable recovery interval &lt;###&gt;</em>

Below are some default settings and the commands to modify them:
<table border=""1"">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Setting</td>
<td>Default</td>
<td>Commands</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bridge ID</td>
<td>Priority + MAC</td>
<td>spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> root {primary | secondary}
spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> priority <em>priority</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interface Cost</td>
<td>100Mbps=19, 1Gbps=4, 10Gbps=2</td>
<td>spanning-tree vlan <em>vlan-id</em> cost <em>cost</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Port Fast</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>spanning-tree portfast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BPDU Guard</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>spanning-tree bpduguard enable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
To alleviate some of the need for STP, but still retain port failure high availability you can configure ports in EtherChannels with multiple interfaces added to a port channel:
<em>(config-if)# channel-group &lt;group#&gt; mode on</em>

And finally some helpful debug and show commands:
<em>show spanning-tree vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt;</em><em>
show spanning-tree summary totals
show etherchannel &lt;#&gt; summary
debug spanning-tree events</em>

Feel free to comment any suggestions or corrections!",,
2/10/2010 22:04,STP Notes Continued,"STP, RSTP, PVST+, RPVST

STP (802.1d) - Spanning Tree Protocol - Covered <a href=""http://robertj.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/stp-notes/"">Here</a>

RSTP (802.1w) - Rapid STP
Improves convergence times by reducing waiting times when reacting to changes in topology. Renames port states to Discarding, Learning, and Forwarding. Implements a feature to characterize connectivity methods called either Link-type (Switch-to-Switch) or Edge-type(Switch-to-Device). Adds additional port roles to include Root Port, Designated Port, Alternate Port (like a backup RP), Backup Port (when 2 links exist in the same collision domain), and Disabled port (shutdown ports). In RSTP, instead of waiting to forward Hello BPDUs from the root switch, switches independently create Hello BPDUs.

PVST+, PVRST or RPVST
Allows creation of spanning trees for each VLAN. By doing so you are able to load-balance VLANs across trunks by setting different port costs for the different VLAN spanning-trees. The ability to create separate spanning trees for each VLAN is made possible by extending the Bridge ID. As I noted earlier the Bridge ID is made up of a priority and part of the MAC address. PVST and RPVST go a step further and extend the priority field into a smaller priority field and a System ID field which holds the VLAN ID. This will create a different BID for each VLAN.",,
2/4/2010 16:45,STP Notes,"Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents switched loops from occurring in redundant topologies by placing ports in either a Forwarding (alive) state or a Blocking (dead) state. STP makes changes to port states based on topology changes as necessary, allowing for redundant links to be brought up and down as necessary.

Terms:
<ul>
	<li>Root Switch - Lowest Bridge ID; All ports forwarding</li>
	<li>Root Port - On non-root switches, the port with the lowest admin cost to root switch</li>
	<li>Designated Bridge -Lowest cost switch to the root switch on an Ethernet segment</li>
	<li>Designated Port - Port connecting the designated bridge to the segment</li>
	<li>STP Bridge ID (BID) - Unique ID of each switch composed of a priority field and system ID</li>
	<li>Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) - messages that switches use to exchange info with each other</li>
	<li>Hello BPDU - Lists the sending switch's BID, the current root switch's BID, Cost to reach the root switch, and timer values of the root switch</li>
</ul>
Process:
<ol>
	<li>Elect a Root Switch</li>
	<li>Select Switch Root Port</li>
	<li>Select Switch Designated Port</li>
	<li>(All other ports are placed in a Blocking State)</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">1. Electing a Root Switch
Each switch begins by sending out it's Hello BPDUs with its own BID listed as the root switch. If a switch encounters a Hello BPDU with a lower root BID, called a Superior Hello, then it acknowledges that switch as the root switch, stops originating Hellos, and begins forwarding the Superior Hello modified to include the correct sender BID and new root BID. This process continues until all switches in the topology agree on a single root switch.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">2. Selecting a Switch's Root Port
The root port is the switch port with the lowest STP cost to reach the root switch. A switch calculates each port cost by adding the advertised cost, which was received in the Hello BPDU, to the interface cost, which is configured on the switch.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:30px;"">3. Selecting a Switch's Designated Port
When a non-root switch forwards a Hello BPDU, it includes it's cost to the root switch. The switch port with the lowest advertised cost to the root on a segment is the Designated Port. If the advertised costs are tied the switch with lower BID wins and is the Designated Port.</p>
<p style=""padding-left:60px;"">Default Port Costs:
10 Mbps - 100
100 Mbps - 19
1 Gbps - 4
10 Gbps - 2</p>
So far I've described the process by which STP creates it's initial topology. As part of a continual process the root switch sends out a Hello, by default, every 2 seconds with a cost of 0. Other switches will receive this Hello on their Root Ports, change the sender's BID, update the cost-to-root, and forward the Hello out their Designated Ports.

When a switch either does not receive a Hello by the MaxAge time-out, or it's Root Port goes down, the switch begins the whole process over in order to determine if it's the Root Switch, and if not, what ports should be the RP and DP. The entire process for an interface to move from a Blocking State to a Forwarding state could take up to 50 seconds as it waits for the MaxAge time-out (10x Hello timer or 20 seconds by default), waits 30 seconds in Listening and Learning states, before arriving at a Forwarding state.

Feel free to comment or email me if I made any mistakes.",,
