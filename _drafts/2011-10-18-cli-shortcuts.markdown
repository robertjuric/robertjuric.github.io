In my attempt to become a CLI wizard I felt like I needed to gain a little more speed and control when I'm at the command line. Holding down arrow keys or the backspace key is really a time waster, and not very accurate. So I dug around a little and found these shortcut combos. I've tested them in PuTTY on both a Cisco and Juniper device.
