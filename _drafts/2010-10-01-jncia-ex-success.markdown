Thought I'd share a little good news... I took my JNCIA-EX exam today, and I passed! The Juniper exam seems to be a little more JUNOS orientated instead of the networking fundamentals that the CCNA containted. There were no subnetting questions, and the exam almost assumes a prior knowledge of the networking basics (though the O'Reilly JUNOS Ent. Switching book does cover the basics). 

Overall I'd say it was a good exam and I look forward to starting my study for the JNCIS-ENT.
