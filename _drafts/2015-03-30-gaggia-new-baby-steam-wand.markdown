We recently purchased a refurbished Gaggia New Baby espresso machine and grinder. We've been very pleased with the results (and the cost). The one complaint (and the only one so far) was the stock steam wand. It did a great job at making foam, though more than we care for and it was a pain to keep clean. I saw online that it was possible to replace the steam wand on a Gaggia Classic with one from a Rancilio Silvia so I took the chance and purchased a Rancilio Sivlia steam wand for $15 from eBay. What follows are the general instructions necessary to make this swap work on a Gaggia New Baby.

First, remove the water tank and disconnect the power. Then remove the two screws from the back side. The are located underneath where the water tank was located on the black plastic. No need to remove the ones on the silver plastic.

Next pull the steam control knob straight up to remove it and remove the screw at the top of the machine.

Next lay the machine on its back with the bottom facing up. There are 2 screws underneath, next to the group head.

Next stand the machine upright and slowly pull the black cover straight up to remove it from the rest of the machine. There is enough slack in the wiring harness which allowed me to keep everything connected, I just laid it aside. You'll see where the hose connecting to the steam wand is located and there is a small plate with 2 screws. Remove the screws and slide the plate up. The factory wand will pull up through the housing.

The next part is probably the hardest step, but that isn't saying much. There is a plastic clip securing the wand to the round ball and the hose. I found the easiest way to do this was the secure the wand in my left and use my thumb and forefinger to put upward pressure on the ball. Then take a small flat head screwdriver and use it to push the 3 clips inside the ball toward the center. Keeping the upward pressure will hold them as work you way around to all 3 clips inside. I've tried to capture this as best as possible but it was hard to get a good shot.

With the clip removed slide it down the factory wand and pull out the factory wand.

I saw on some videos that the Rancilio Silivia wand had a flared end that sometimes had to be "flattened" in order to remove the large factory nut. Mine was not flared and the nut and washer easily slid off when I unscrewed the nozzle. I just put the plastic clip onto the Rancilio wand and pushed it back into the ball.

Re-assemble in opposite order. Secure the cover on the steam wand, put the case back on. 2 screws underneath next to the group head, one under the steam control knob, finally the last 2 screws on the black plastic underneath where the water tank sits. Then just screw the nozzle back onto the Rancilio wand, and give her a spin.

Our complete espresso setup, for less than $500 we couldn't be happier!
