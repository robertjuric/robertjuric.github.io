I recently took (and passed) the JN0-101 JNCIA-Junos exam. I spent my time studying and taking notes, but when it gets to crunch time I like to condense my notes into a quick study sheet. I use this study sheet to look at the day of the exam and right before I walk into the testing center. These aren't complete notes, they're only a summary that's useful for last minute studying and staying fresh. I've got a few notebooks in my office from various certifications, but this time I thought I would put my study sheet into an electronic format and share it with the world. A few thoughts on my notes first:

I like to write notes in the long hierarchy form because I am a visual creature. Every indentation level I see could be a new edit or set hierarchy. If I start in a particular hierarchy, I either talk about it in my notes or specify the [edit] level just as you would see in the CLI. Sometimes my curly brackets do not correctly align with the configuration. It makes no sense to waste 5 lines just for curly brackets.

I use < and > to identify variable names.
I use '/' to identify multiple options
If there is an optional command completion I list it in '( )'
