It took me quite some time to get this figured out so I thought it would be a good first post to share with you. Configuration took piecing together information from a few different sources; I could not find one definitive answer on how to configure a router with this card. Hopefully somebody will find this information useful. Also, A good reference can be found on Cisco's website [here](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/access/1800/1861/software/feature/guide/3ghwic.html).

Materials:



	
  * Cisco 1841 Router

	
  * HWIC-3G-GSM

	
  * AT&T SIM Card


Quick Config Breakdown:
(Disclaimer: This is not meant to be a technical guide, for a complete command reference, see Google.)

1. Configure a Cellular Modem Profile_ _


_router# cellular0/0/0 gsm profile create 1 <apn_name>_


2. Configure DDR


_(config)# __chat-script gsm "" "ATDT*99***1#" TIMEOUT 60 "CONNECT"_




_(config)# __dialer-list 1 protocol ip permit_




_(config)# __line 0/0/0
__(config-line)#__ script dialer gsm
__(config-line)#__ modem InOut
__(config-line)#__ transport input all
__(config-line)#__ exit
_


3. Configure the Cellular Interface


_(config)# interface Cellular0/0/0
__(config-if)# __ip address negotiated
__(config-if)# __encapsulation ppp
__(config-if)# __ dialer in-band
__(config-if)# __ dialer idle-timeout 300
__(config-if)# __ dialer string gsm
__(config-if)# __ dialer-group 1
__(config-if)# __ async mode interactive
__(config-if)# __ ppp chap hostname dummy
__(config-if)# __ ppp chap password dummy
__(config-if)# __ exit_


From here make sure you have a default route setup and attempt to send some traffic out the Cellular interface with a ping. You should see the interface come up and the pings start succeeding.

Notes:
The chat-script and chap authentication were configured based on information gleamed from AT&T, it will vary from carrier to carrier.

This is merely how I configured my router to work with our AT&T APN. On top of this configuration, add some lines for NAT, a VPN tunnel, and you have yourself a Cellular Enabled Router. Feel free to post any comments or questions.
