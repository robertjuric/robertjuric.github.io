## How It All Started
I've read about people switching to markdown and crowing about how great the writing experience was, but I never gave it much thought. Maybe since I've never taken my writing *that* seriously I was always content with my previous writing tools (Wordpress.org). What I began to notice was my use of plaintext writing for work. I have a lot of small projects going on at work and to be able to track everything I started keeping a small text file for each project, coupled with a tabbed text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and I began to feel pretty organized. and Organized makes me happy. After that I slowly started falling out of love with Wordpress. I can't really say why, I was getting slightly tired of constantly updating Wordpress and it's plugins and wasn't entirely happy with my hosting provider. Or it could have just been my digital nomadic nature wanting me to move onto something new. 

I stumbled upon Jekyll, and I recall some previous technology bloggers making the switch. Free hosting on GitHub pages sealed the deal for me, I was converted. Since then I've had to work hard to migrate everything from Wordpress, and I'm slowly working myself into a groove with markdown.

## Tools I've Used

	* SublimeText  
	* Markdown Extended Package  
	* Monokai Extended Color Scheme   

I started using SublimeText on my MBA for some coding I've been dabbling in. I really enjoyed Sublime for its syntax highlighting and tabbed windows. I also tried some markdown specific editors like Mou, but I wasn't crazy about having to switch between text editors. So I set out to find a way to make markdown in SublimeText more enjoyable and I stumbled across Marius Schulz [blog post](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2014/12/16/how-to-set-up-sublime-text-for-a-vastly-better-markdown-writing-experience) about markdown and SublimeText. That post put me onto the Markdown Extended package and the Monokai Extended color scheme, both of which I've been pretty happy with so far.

I've been plugging along cleaning up my horrible Wordpress formatting into clean text. I have to say I'm pretty happy with the new setup so far.
