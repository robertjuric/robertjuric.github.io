I took the Solarwinds Certified Professional (SCP) exam yesterday; I passed! There is not much study material for the exam, so I thought I would share a few things that stood out to me.

I feel I am strong in the basic network management principles, and I've been using Solarwinds for almost 2 years now, so most of the basic and Solarwinds usage questions I was able to answer without much thought. There was one question concerning configuring syslog to send messages on OSPF updates that I felt inadequate to answer. A majority of questions that really stood out to me were regarding how to size Orion; when to upgrade your SQL server, how to size licensing, whether to use a distributed or central management system, etc.

I don't want to share too much information, so I'll leave you with this:



	
  * Know the network management protocols and how to use them for troubleshooting

	
  * Know how to size different aspects of Orion (licenses, pollers, databases, etc)

	
  * Know how to use Solarwinds modules (Advanced Alert Manager, Report Writer, Map Builder, etc)

	
  * Know how to use Solarwinds to meet business needs (Types of Reports, Alerts, SLAs)
